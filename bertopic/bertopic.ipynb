       "['Warren G. Harding\\t3/4/1921\\tWhen one surveys the world about him after the great storm, noting the marks of destruction and yet rejoicing in the ruggedness of the things which withstood it, if he is an American he breathes the clarified atmosphere with a strange mingling of regret and new hope. We have seen a world passion spend its fury, but we contemplate our Republic unshaken, and hold our civilization secure. Liberty--liberty within the law--and civilization are inseparable, and though both were threatened we find them now secure; and there comes to Americans the profound assurance that our representative government is the highest expression and surest guaranty of both Standing in this presence, mindful of the solemnity of this occasion, feeling the emotions which no one may know until he senses the great weight of responsibility for himself, I must utter my belief in the divine inspiration of the founding fathers. Surely there must have been God\\'s intent in the making of this new-world Republic. Ours is an organic law which had but one ambiguity, and we saw that effaced in a baptism of sacrifice and blood, with union maintained, the Nation supreme, and its concord inspiring. We have seen the world rivet its hopeful gaze on the great truths on which the founders wrought. We have seen civil, human, and religious liberty verified and glorified. In the beginning the Old World scoffed at our experiment; today our foundations of political and social belief stand unshaken, a precious inheritance to ourselves, an inspiring example of freedom and civilization to all mankind. Let us express renewed and strengthened devotion, in grateful reverence for the immortal beginning, and utter our confidence in the supreme fulfillment The recorded progress of our Republic, materially and spiritually, in itself proves the wisdom of the inherited policy of noninvolvement in Old World affairs. Confident of our ability to work out our own destiny, and jealously guarding our right to do so, we seek no part in directing the destinies of the Old World. We do not mean to be entangled. We will accept no responsibility except as our own conscience and judgment, in each instance, may determine Our eyes never will be blind to a developing menace, our ears never deaf to the call of civilization. We recognize the new order in the world, with the closer contacts which progress has wrought. We sense the call of the human heart for fellowship, fraternity, and cooperation. We crave friendship and harbor no hate. But America, our America, the America builded on the foundation laid by the inspired fathers, can be a party to no permanent military alliance. It can enter into no political commitments, nor assume any economic obligations which will subject our decisions to any other than our own authority I am sure our own people will not misunderstand, nor will the world misconstrue. We have no thought to impede the paths to closer relationship. We wish to promote understanding. We want to do our part in making offensive warfare so hateful that Governments and peoples who resort to it must prove the righteousness of their cause or stand as outlaws before the bar of civilization We are ready to associate ourselves with the nations of the world, great and small, for conference, for counsel; to seek the expressed views of world opinion; to recommend a way to approximate disarmament and relieve the crushing burdens of military and naval establishments. We elect to participate in suggesting plans for mediation, conciliation, and arbitration, and would gladly join in that expressed conscience of progress, which seeks to clarify and write the laws of international relationship, and establish a world court for the disposition of such justiciable questions as nations are agreed to submit thereto. In expressing aspirations, in seeking practical plans, in translating humanity\\'s new concept of righteousness and justice and its hatred of war into recommended action we are ready most heartily to unite, but every commitment must be made in the exercise of our national sovereignty. Since freedom impelled, and independence inspired, and nationality exalted, a world supergovernment is contrary to everything we cherish and can have no sanction by our Republic. This is not selfishness, it is sanctity. It is not aloofness, it is security. It is not suspicion of others, it is patriotic adherence to the things which made us what we are Today, better than ever before, we know the aspirations of humankind, and share them. We have come to a new realization of our place in the world and a new appraisal of our Nation by the world. The unselfishness of these United States is a thing proven; our devotion to peace for ourselves and for the world is well established; our concern for preserved civilization has had its impassioned and heroic expression. There was no American failure to resist the attempted reversion of civilization; there will be no failure today or tomorrow The success of our popular government rests wholly upon the correct interpretation of the deliberate, intelligent, dependable popular will of America. In a deliberate questioning of a suggested change of national policy, where internationality was to supersede nationality, we turned to a referendum, to the American people. There was ample discussion, and there is a public mandate in manifest understanding America is ready to encourage, eager to initiate, anxious to participate in any seemly program likely to lessen the probability of war, and promote that brotherhood of mankind which must be God\\'s highest conception of human relationship. Because we cherish ideals of justice and peace, because we appraise international comity and helpful relationship no less highly than any people of the world, we aspire to a high place in the moral leadership of civilization, and we hold a maintained America, the proven Republic, the unshaken temple of representative democracy, to be not only an inspiration and example, but the highest agency of strengthening good will and promoting accord on both continents Mankind needs a world-wide benediction of understanding. It is needed among individuals, among peoples, among governments, and it will inaugurate an era of good feeling to make the birth of a new order. In such understanding men will strive confidently for the promotion of their better relationships and nations will promote the comities so essential to peace We must understand that ties of trade bind nations in closest intimacy, and none may receive except as he gives. We have not strengthened ours in accordance with our resources or our genius, notably on our own continent, where a galaxy of Republics reflects the glory of new-world democracy, but in the new order of finance and trade we mean to promote enlarged activities and seek expanded confidence Perhaps we can make no more helpful contribution by example than prove a Republic\\'s capacity to emerge from the wreckage of war. While the world\\'s embittered travail did not leave us devastated lands nor desolated cities, left no gaping wounds, no breast with hate, it did involve us in the delirium of expenditure, in expanded currency and credits, in unbalanced industry, in unspeakable waste, and disturbed relationships. While it uncovered our portion of hateful selfishness at home, it also revealed the heart of America as sound and fearless, and beating in confidence unfailing Amid it all we have riveted the gaze of all civilization to the unselfishness and the righteousness of representative democracy, where our freedom never has made offensive warfare, never has sought territorial aggrandizement through force, never has turned to the arbitrament of arms until reason has been exhausted. When the Governments of the earth shall have established a freedom like our own and shall have sanctioned the pursuit of peace as we have practiced it, I believe the last sorrow and the final sacrifice of international warfare will have been written Let me speak to the maimed and wounded soldiers who are present today, and through them convey to their comrades the gratitude of the Republic for their sacrifices in its defense. A generous country will never forget the services you rendered, and you may hope for a policy under Government that will relieve any maimed successors from taking your places on another such occasion as this Our supreme task is the resumption of our onward, normal way. Reconstruction, readjustment, restoration all these must follow. I would like to hasten them. If it will lighten the spirit and add to the resolution with which we take up the task, let me repeat for our Nation, we shall give no people just cause to make war upon us; we hold no national prejudices; we entertain no spirit of revenge; we do not hate; we do not covet; we dream of no conquest, nor boast of armed prowess If, despite this attitude, war is again forced upon us, I earnestly hope a way may be found which will unify our individual and collective strength and consecrate all America, materially and spiritually, body and soul, to national defense. I can vision the ideal republic, where every man and woman is called under the flag for assignment to duty for whatever service, military or civic, the individual is best fitted; where we may call to universal service every plant, agency, or facility, all in the sublime sacrifice for country, and not one penny of war profit shall inure to the benefit of private individual, corporation, or combination, but all above the normal shall flow into the defense chest of the Nation. There is something inherently wrong, something out of accord with the ideals of representative democracy, when one portion of our citizenship turns its activities to private gain amid defensive war while another is fighting, sacrificing, or dying for national preservation Out of such universal service will come a new unity of spirit and purpose, a new confidence and consecration, which would make our defense impregnable, our triumph assured. Then we should have little or no disorganization of our economic, industrial, and commercial systems at home, no staggering war debts, no swollen fortunes to flout the sacrifices of our soldiers, no excuse for sedition, no pitiable slackerism, no outrage of treason. Envy and jealousy would have no soil for their menacing development, and revolution would be without the passion which engenders it A regret for the mistakes of yesterday must not, however, blind us to the tasks of today. War never left such an aftermath. There has been staggering loss of life and measureless wastage of materials. Nations are still groping for return to stable ways. Discouraging indebtedness confronts us like all the war-torn nations, and these obligations must be provided for. No civilization can survive repudiation We can reduce the abnormal expenditures, and we will. We can strike at war taxation, and we must. We must face the grim necessity, with full knowledge that the task is to be solved, and we must proceed with a full realization that no statute enacted by man can repeal the inexorable laws of nature. Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too much of government, and at the same time do for it too little. We contemplate the immediate task of putting our public household in order. We need a rigid and yet sane economy, combined with fiscal justice, and it must be attended by individual prudence and thrift, which are so essential to this trying hour and reassuring for the future The business world reflects the disturbance of war\\'s reaction. Herein flows the lifeblood of material existence. The economic mechanism is intricate and its parts interdependent, and has suffered the shocks and jars incident to abnormal demands, credit inflations, and price upheavals. The normal balances have been impaired, the channels of distribution have been clogged, the relations of labor and management have been strained. We must seek the readjustment with care and courage. Our people must give and take. Prices must reflect the receding fever of war activities. Perhaps we never shall know the old levels of wages again, because war invariably readjusts compensations, and the necessaries of life will show their inseparable relationship, but we must strive for normalcy to reach stability. All the penalties will not be light, nor evenly distributed. There is no way of making them so. There is no instant step from disorder to order. We must face a condition of grim reality, charge off our losses and start afresh. It is the oldest lesson of civilization. I would like government to do all it can to mitigate; then, in understanding, in mutuality of interest, in concern for the common good, our tasks will be solved. No altered system will work a miracle. Any wild experiment will only add to the confusion. Our best assurance lies in efficient administration of our proven system The forward course of the business cycle is unmistakable. Peoples are turning from destruction to production. Industry has sensed the changed order and our own people are turning to resume their normal, onward way. The call is for productive America to go on. I know that Congress and the Administration will favor every wise Government policy to aid the resumption and encourage continued progress I speak for administrative efficiency, for lightened tax burdens, for sound commercial practices, for adequate credit facilities, for sympathetic concern for all agricultural problems, for the omission of unnecessary interference of Government with business, for an end to Government\\'s experiment in business, and for more efficient business in Government administration. With all of this must attend a mindfulness of the human side of all activities, so that social, industrial, and economic justice will be squared with the purposes of a righteous people With the nation-wide induction of womanhood into our political life, we may count upon her intuitions, her refinements, her intelligence, and her influence to exalt the social order. We count upon her exercise of the full privileges and the performance of the duties of citizenship to speed the attainment of the highest state I wish for an America no less alert in guarding against dangers from within than it is watchful against enemies from without. Our fundamental law recognizes no class, no group, no section; there must be none in legislation or administration. The supreme inspiration is the common weal. Humanity hungers for international peace, and we crave it with all mankind. My most reverent prayer for America is for industrial peace, with its rewards, widely and generally distributed, amid the inspirations of equal opportunity. No one justly may deny the equality of opportunity which made us what we are. We have mistaken unpreparedness to embrace it to be a challenge of the reality, and due concern for making all citizens fit for participation will give added strength of citizenship and magnify our achievement If revolution insists upon overturning established order, let other peoples make the tragic experiment. There is no place for it in America. When World War threatened civilization we pledged our resources and our lives to its preservation, and when revolution threatens we unfurl the flag of law and order and renew our consecration. Ours is a constitutional freedom where the popular will is the law supreme and minorities are sacredly protected. Our revisions, reformations, and evolutions reflect a deliberate judgment and an orderly progress, and we mean to cure our ills, but never destroy or permit destruction by force I had rather submit our industrial controversies to the conference table in advance than to a settlement table after conflict and suffering. The earth is thirsting for the cup of good will, understanding is its fountain source. I would like to acclaim an era of good feeling amid dependable prosperity and all the blessings which attend It has been proved again and again that we cannot, while throwing our markets open to the world, maintain American standards of living and opportunity, and hold our industrial eminence in such unequal competition. There is a luring fallacy in the theory of banished barriers of trade, but preserved American standards require our higher production costs to be reflected in our tariffs on imports. Today, as never before, when peoples are seeking trade restoration and expansion, we must adjust our tariffs to the new order. We seek participation in the world\\'s exchanges, because therein lies our way to widened influence and the triumphs of peace. We know full well we cannot sell where we do not buy, and we cannot sell successfully where we do not carry. Opportunity is calling not alone for the restoration, but for a new era in production, transportation and trade. We shall answer it best by meeting the demand of a surpassing home market, by promoting self-reliance in production, and by bidding enterprise, genius, and efficiency to carry our cargoes in American bottoms to the marts of the world We would not have an America living within and for herself alone, but we would have her self-reliant, independent, and ever nobler, stronger, and richer. Believing in our higher standards, reared through constitutional liberty and maintained opportunity, we invite the world to the same heights. But pride in things wrought is no reflex of a completed task. Common welfare is the goal of our national endeavor. Wealth is not inimical to welfare; it ought to be its friendliest agency. There never can be equality of rewards or possessions so long as the human plan contains varied talents and differing degrees of industry and thrift, but ours ought to be a country free from the great blotches of distressed poverty. We ought to find a way to guard against the perils and penalties of unemployment. We want an America of homes, illumined with hope and happiness, where mothers, freed from the necessity for long hours of toil beyond their own doors, may preside as befits the hearthstone of American citizenship. We want the cradle of American childhood rocked under conditions so wholesome and so hopeful that no blight may touch it in its development, and we want to provide that no selfish interest, no material necessity, no lack of opportunity shall prevent the gaining of that education so essential to best citizenship There is no short cut to the making of these ideals into glad realities. The world has witnessed again and again the futility and the mischief of ill-considered remedies for social and economic disorders. But we are mindful today as never before of the friction of modern industrialism, and we must learn its causes and reduce its evil consequences by sober and tested methods. Where genius has made for great possibilities, justice and happiness must be reflected in a greater common welfare Service is the supreme commitment of life. I would rejoice to acclaim the era of the Golden Rule and crown it with the autocracy of service. I pledge an administration wherein all the agencies of Government are called to serve, and ever promote an understanding of Government purely as an expression of the popular will One cannot stand in this presence and be unmindful of the tremendous responsibility. The world upheaval has added heavily to our tasks. But with the realization comes the surge of high resolve, and there is reassurance in belief in the God-given destiny of our Republic. If I felt that there is to be sole responsibility in the Executive for the America of tomorrow I should shrink from the burden. But here are a hundred millions, with common concern and shared responsibility, answerable to God and country. The Republic summons them to their duty, and I invite co-operation I accept my part with single-mindedness of purpose and humility of spirit, and implore the favor and guidance of God in His Heaven. With these I am unafraid, and confidently face the future I have taken the solemn oath of office on that passage of Holy Writ wherein it is asked: What doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\" This I plight to God and country.\"',\n",

Senator John Stennis, God bless you and welcome back.  There is, however, one who is not with us today. Representative Gillis Long of Louisiana left us last night. And I wonder if we could all join in a moment of silent prayer.  [The President resumed speaking after a moment of silence. ]  Amen.  There are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great honor that you\\'ve bestowed on me. I\\'ll do my utmost to be deserving of your trust.  This is, as Senator Mathias told us, the 50th time that we, the people, have celebrated this historic occasion. When the first President, George Washington, placed his hand upon the Bible, he stood less than a single day\\'s journey by horseback from raw, untamed wilderness. There were 4 million Americans in a union of 13 States. Today, we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 States. We\\'ve lighted the world with our inventions, gone to the aid of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help, journeyed to the Moon and safely returned. So much has changed, and yet we stand together as we did two centuries ago.  When I took this oath 4 years ago, I did so in a time of economic stress. Voices were raised saying that we had to look to our past for the greatness and glory. But we, the present-day Americans, are not given to looking backward. In this blessed land, there is always a better tomorrow.  Four years ago, I spoke to you of a New Beginning, and we have accomplished that. But in another sense, our New Beginning is a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when, for the first time in history, government, the people said, was not our master, it is our servant; its only power that which we the people allow it to have.  That system has never failed us, but for a time we failed the system. We asked things of government that government was not equipped to give. We yielded authority to the National Government that properly belonged to States or to local governments or to the people themselves. We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine that had made us the most productive people on Earth slow down and the number of unemployed increase.  By 1980 we knew it was time to renew our faith, to strive with all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom, consistent with an orderly society.  We believed then and now: There are no limits to growth and human progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams. And we were right to believe that. Tax rates have been reduced, inflation cut dramatically, and more people are employed than ever before in our history.  We are creating a nation once again vibrant, robust, and alive. But there are many mountains yet to climb. We will not rest until every American enjoys the fullness of freedom, dignity, and opportunity as our birthright. It is our birthright as citizens of this great Republic.  And if we meet this challenge, these will be years when Americans have restored their confidence and tradition of progress; when our values of faith, family, work, and neighborhood were restated for a modern age; when our economy was finally freed from government\\'s grip; when we made sincere efforts at meaningful arms reductions and by rebuilding our defenses, our economy, and developing new technologies, helped preserve peace in a troubled world; when America courageously supported the struggle for individual liberty, self-government, and free enterprise throughout the world and turned the tide of history away from totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom.  My fellow citizens, our nation is poised for greatness. We must do what we know is right, and do it with all our might. Let history say of us: \"These were golden years-when the American Revolution was reborn, when freedom gained new life, and America reached for her best.  Our two-party system has solved us-served us, I should say, well over the years, but never better than in those times of great challenge when we came together not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans united in a common cause.  Two of our Founding Fathers, a Boston lawyer named Adams and a Virginia planter named Jefferson, members of that remarkable group who met in Independence Hall and dared to think they could start the world over again, left us an important lesson. They had become, in the years then in government, bitter political rivals in the Presidential election of 1800. Then, years later, when both were retired and age had softened their anger, they began to speak to each other again through letters. A bond was reestablished between those two who had helped create this government of ours.  In 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, they both died. They died on the same day, within a few hours of each other, and that day was the Fourth of July.  In one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives, Jefferson wrote: \"It carries me back to the times when, beset with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right of self-government. Laboring always at the same oar, with some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing harmless... we rode through the storm with heart and hand.\"  Well, with heart and hand let us stand as one today—one people under God, determined that our future shall be worthy of our past. As we do, we must not repeat the well-intentioned errors of our past. We must never again abuse the trust of working men and women by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling demands of a bloated Federal Establishment. You elected us in 1980 to end this prescription for disaster, and I don\\'t believe you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course.  At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight months of economic growth: Freedom and incentives unleash the drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress. We have begun to increase the rewards for work, savings, and investment; reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in people\\'s lives.  We must simplify our tax system, make it more fair and bring the rates down for all who work and earn. We must think anew and move with a new boldness, so every American who seeks work can find work, so the least among us shall have an equal chance to achieve the greatest things—to be heroes who heal our sick, feed the hungry, protect peace among nations, and leave this world a better place.  The time has come for a new American emancipation—a great national drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country. My friends, together we can do this, and do it we must, so help me God.  From new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth, a more productive, fulfilled, and united people, and a stronger America—an America that will lead the technological revolution and also open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature, music, and poetry, and the values of faith, courage, and love.  A dynamic economy, with more citizens working and paying taxes, will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits. But an almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought us to a time of reckoning. We\\'ve come to a turning point, a moment for hard decisions. I have asked the Cabinet and my staff a question and now I put the same question to all of you. If not us, who? And if not now, when? It must be done by all of us going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget. We can then begin reducing the national debt.  I will shortly submit a budget to the Congress aimed at freezing government program spending for the next year. Beyond this, we must take further steps to permanently control government\\'s power to tax and spend. We must act now to protect future generations from government\\'s desire to spend its citizens\\' money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due. Let us make it unconstitutional for the Federal Government to spend more than the Federal Government takes in.  We have already started returning to the people and to State and local governments responsibilities better handled by them. Now, there is a place for the Federal Government in matters of social compassion. But our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged. And here, a growing economy and support from family and community offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way of life, where the old and infirm are cared for, the young and, yes, the unborn protected, and the unfortunate looked after and made self-sufficient.  Now, there is another area where the Federal Government can play a part. As an older American, I remember a time when people of different race, creed, or ethnic origin in our land found hatred and prejudice installed in social custom and, yes, in law. There\\'s no story more heartening in our history than the progress that we\\'ve made toward the brotherhood of man that God intended for us. Let us resolve there will be no turning back or hesitation on the road to an America rich in dignity and abundant with opportunity for all our citizens.  Let us resolve that we, the people, will build an American opportunity society in which all of us—white and black, rich and poor, young and old—will go forward together, arm in arm. Again, let us remember that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner of the Earth, we are all Americans, pledged to carry on this last, best hope of man on Earth.  I\\'ve spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations we should put on our National Government. Now let me turn to a task that is the primary responsibility of National Government—the safety and security of our people.  Today, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on Earth. Yet history has shown that peace does not come, nor will our freedom be preserved, by good will alone. There are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and freedom. One nation, the Soviet Union, has conducted the greatest military buildup in the history of man, building arsenals of awesome offensive weapons.  We\\'ve made progress in restoring our defense capability. But much remains to be done. There must be no wavering by us, nor any doubts by others, that America will meet her responsibilities to remain free, secure, and at peace.  There is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national security, and that is to reduce the need for it. And this we\\'re trying to do in negotiations with the Soviet Union. We\\'re not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear weapons; we seek, instead, to reduce their number. We seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth.  Now, for decades, we and the Soviets have lived under the threat of mutual assured destruction—if either resorted to the use of nuclear weapons, the other could retaliate and destroy the one who had started it. Is there either logic or morality in believing that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs?  I have approved a research program to find, if we can, a security shield that will destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their target. It wouldn\\'t kill people; it would destroy weapons. It wouldn\\'t militarize space; it would help demilitarize the arsenals of Earth. It would render nuclear weapons obsolete. We will meet with the Soviets, hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the world of the threat of nuclear destruction.  We strive for peace and security, heartened by the changes all around us. Since the turn of the century, the number of democracies in the world has grown fourfold. Human freedom is on the march, and nowhere more so than in our own hemisphere. Freedom is one of the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit. People, worldwide, hunger for the right of self-determination, for those inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress.  America must remain freedom\\'s staunchest friend, for freedom is our best ally and it is the world\\'s only hope to conquer poverty and preserve peace. Every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against its dark allies of oppression and war. Every victory for human freedom will be a victory for world peace.  So, we go forward today, a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful in its purpose. With our alliances strengthened, with our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion, we look to a future rich in possibilities. And all of this is because we worked and acted together, not as members of political parties but as Americans.  My friends, we live in a world that\\'s lit by lightning. So much is changing and will change, but so much endures and transcends time.  History is a ribbon, always unfurling. History is a journey. And as we continue our journey, we think of those who traveled before us. We stand again at the steps of this symbol of our democracy—well, we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn\\'t gotten so cold. [Laughter] Now we\\'re standing inside this symbol of our democracy, and we see and hear again the echoes of our past: a general falls to his knees in the hard snow of Valley Forge; a lonely President paces the darkened halls and ponders his struggle to preserve the Union; the men of the Alamo call out encouragement to each other; a settler pushes west and sings a song, and the song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air.  It is the American sound. It is hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic, daring, decent, and fair. That\\'s our heritage, that\\'s our song. We sing it still. For all our problems, our differences, we are together as of old. We raise our voices to the God who is the Author of this most tender music. And may He continue to hold us close as we fill the world with our sound—in unity, affection, and love—one people under God, dedicated to the dream of freedom that He has placed in the human heart, called upon now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world.<br>God bless you, and God bless America.',\n",
       " 'Calvin Coolidge\\t3/4/1925\\tMy Countrymen No one can contemplate current conditions without finding much that is satisfying and still more that is encouraging. Our own country is leading the world in the general readjustment to the results of the great conflict. Many of its burdens will bear heavily upon us for years, and the secondary and indirect effects we must expect to experience for some time. But we are beginning to comprehend more definitely what course should be pursued, what remedies ought to be applied, what actions should be taken for our deliverance, and are clearly manifesting a determined will faithfully and conscientiously to adopt these methods of relief. Already we have sufficiently rearranged our domestic affairs so that confidence has returned, business has revived, and we appear to be entering an era of prosperity which is gradually reaching into every part of the Nation. Realizing that we  cannot live unto ourselves alone, we have contributed of our resources and our counsel to the relief of the suffering and the settlement of the disputes among the European nations. Because of what America is and what America has done, a firmer courage, a higher hope, inspires the heart of all humanity These results have not occurred by mere chance. They have been secured by a constant and enlightened effort marked by many sacrifices and extending over many generations. We  cannot continue these brilliant successes in the future, unless we continue to learn from the past. It is necessary to keep the former experiences of our country both at home and abroad continually before us, if we are to have any science of government. If we wish to erect new structures, we must have a definite knowledge of the old foundations. We must realize that human nature is about the most constant thing in the universe and that the essentials of human relationship do not change. We must frequently take our bearings from these fixed stars of our political firmament if we expect to hold a true course. If we examine carefully what we have done, we can determine the more accurately what we can do We stand at the opening of the one hundred and fiftieth year since our national consciousness first asserted itself by unmistakable action with an array of force. The old sentiment of detached and dependent colonies disappeared in the new sentiment of a united and independent Nation. Men began to discard the narrow confines of a local charter for the broader opportunities of a national constitution. Under the eternal urge of freedom we became an independent Nation. A little less than 50 years later that freedom and independence were reasserted in the face of all the world, and guarded, supported, and secured by the Monroe doctrine. The narrow fringe of States along the Atlantic seaboard advanced its frontiers across the hills and plains of an intervening continent until it passed down the golden slope to the Pacific. We made freedom a birthright. We extended our domain over distant islands in order to safeguard our own interests and accepted the consequent obligation to bestow justice and liberty upon less favored peoples. In the defense of our own ideals and in the general cause of liberty we entered the Great War. When victory had been fully secured, we withdrew to our own shores unrecompensed save in the consciousness of duty done Throughout all these experiences we have enlarged our freedom, we have strengthened our independence. We have been, and propose to be, more and more American. We believe that we can best serve our own country and most successfully discharge our obligations to humanity by continuing to be openly and candidly, intensely and scrupulously, American. If we have any heritage, it has been that. If we have any destiny, we have found it in that direction But if we wish to continue to be distinctively American, we must continue to make that term comprehensive enough to embrace the legitimate desires of a civilized and enlightened people determined in all their relations to pursue a conscientious and religious life. We  cannot permit ourselves to be narrowed and dwarfed by slogans and phrases. It is not the adjective, but the substantive, which is of real importance. It is not the name of the action, but the result of the action, which is the chief concern. It will be well not to be too much disturbed by the thought of either isolation or entanglement of pacifists and militarists. The physical configuration of the earth has separated us from all of the Old World, but the common brotherhood of man, the highest law of all our being, has united us by inseparable bonds with all humanity. Our country represents nothing but peaceful intentions toward all the earth, but it ought not to fail to maintain such a military force as comports with the dignity and security of a great people. It ought to be a balanced force, intensely modern, capable of defense by sea and land, beneath the surface and in the air. But it should be so conducted that all the world may see in it, not a menace, but an instrument of security and peace This Nation believes thoroughly in an honorable peace under which the rights of its citizens are to be everywhere protected. It has never found that the necessary enjoyment of such a peace could be maintained only by a great and threatening array of arms. In common with other nations, it is now more determined than ever to promote peace through friendliness and good will, through mutual understandings and mutual forbearance. We have never practiced the policy of competitive armaments. We have recently committed ourselves by covenants with the other great nations to a limitation of our sea power. As one result of this, our Navy ranks larger, in comparison, than it ever did before. Removing the burden of expense and jealousy, which must always accrue from a keen rivalry, is one of the most effective methods of diminishing that unreasonable hysteria and misunderstanding which are the most potent means of fomenting war. This policy represents a new departure in the world. It is a thought, an ideal, which has led to an entirely new line of action. It will not be easy to maintain. Some never moved from their old positions, some are constantly slipping back to the old ways of thought and the old action of seizing a musket and relying on force. America has taken the lead in this new direction, and that lead America must continue to hold. If we expect others to rely on our fairness and justice we must show that we rely on their fairness and justice If we are to judge by past experience, there is much to be hoped for in international relations from frequent conferences and consultations. We have before us the beneficial results of the Washington conference and the various consultations recently held upon European affairs, some of which were in response to our suggestions and in some of which we were active participants. Even the failures  cannot but be accounted useful and an immeasurable advance over threatened or actual warfare. I am strongly in favor of continuation of this policy, whenever conditions are such that there is even a promise that practical and favorable results might be secured In conformity with the principle that a display of reason rather than a threat of force should be the determining factor in the intercourse among nations, we have long advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes by methods of arbitration and have negotiated many treaties to secure that result. The same considerations should lead to our adherence to the Permanent Court of International Justice. Where great principles are involved, where great movements are under way which promise much for the welfare of humanity by reason of the very fact that many other nations have given such movements their actual support, we ought not to withhold our own sanction because of any small and inessential difference, but only upon the ground of the most important and compelling fundamental reasons. We  cannot barter away our independence or our sovereignty, but we ought to engage in no refinements of logic, no sophistries, and no subterfuges, to argue away the undoubted duty of this country by reason of the might of its numbers, the power of its resources, and its position of leadership in the world, actively and comprehensively to signify its approval and to bear its full share of the responsibility of a candid and disinterested attempt at the establishment of a tribunal for the administration of even-handed justice between nation and nation. The weight of our enormous influence must be cast upon the side of a reign not of force but of law and trial, not by battle but by reason We have never any wish to interfere in the political conditions of any other countries. Especially are we determined not to become implicated in the political controversies of the Old World. With a great deal of hesitation, we have responded to appeals for help to maintain order, protect life and property, and establish responsible government in some of the small countries of the Western Hemisphere. Our private citizens have advanced large sums of money to assist in the necessary financing and relief of the Old World. We have not failed, nor shall we fail to respond, whenever necessary to mitigate human suffering and assist in the rehabilitation of distressed nations. These, too, are requirements which must be met by reason of our vast powers and the place we hold in the world Some of the best thought of mankind has long been seeking for a formula for permanent peace. Undoubtedly the clarification of the principles of international law would be helpful, and the efforts of scholars to prepare such a work for adoption by the various nations should have our sympathy and support. Much may be hoped for from the earnest studies of those who advocate the outlawing of aggressive war. But all these plans and preparations, these treaties and covenants, will not of themselves be adequate. One of the greatest dangers to peace lies in the economic pressure to which people find themselves subjected. One of the most practical things to be done in the world is to seek arrangements under which such pressure may be removed, so that opportunity may be renewed and hope may be revived. There must be some assurance that effort and endeavor will be followed by success and prosperity. In the making and financing of such adjustments there is not only an opportunity, but a real duty, for America to respond with her counsel and her resources. Conditions must be provided under which people can make a living and work out of their difficulties. But there is another element, more important than all, without which there  cannot be the slightest hope of a permanent peace. That element lies in the heart of humanity. Unless the desire for peace be cherished there, unless this fundamental and only natural source of brotherly love be cultivated to its highest degree, all artificial efforts will be in vain. Peace will come when there is realization that only under a reign of law, based on righteousness and supported by the religious conviction of the brotherhood of man, can there be any hope of a complete and satisfying life. Parchment will fail, the sword will fail, it is only the spiritual nature of man that can be triumphant It seems altogether probable that we can contribute most to these important objects by maintaining our position of political detachment and independence. We are not identified with any Old World interests. This position should be made more and more clear in our relations with all foreign countries. We are at peace with all of them. Our program is never to oppress, but always to assist. But while we do justice to others, we must require that justice be done to us. With us a treaty of peace means peace, and a treaty of amity means amity. We have made great contributions to the settlement of contentious differences in both Europe and Asia. But there is a very definite point beyond which we  cannot go. We can only help those who help themselves. Mindful of these limitations, the one great duty that stands out requires us to use our enormous powers to trim the balance of the world While we can look with a great deal of pleasure upon what we have done abroad, we must remember that our continued success in that direction depends upon what we do at home. Since its very outset, it has been found necessary to conduct our Government by means of political parties. That system would not have survived from generation to generation if it had not been fundamentally sound and provided the best instrumentalities for the most complete expression of the popular will. It is not necessary to claim that it has always worked perfectly. It is enough to know that nothing better has been devised. No one would deny that there should be full and free expression and an opportunity for independence of action within the party. There is no salvation in a narrow and bigoted partisanship. But if there is to be responsible party government, the party label must be something more than a mere device for securing office. Unless those who are elected under the same party designation are willing to assume sufficient responsibility and exhibit sufficient loyalty and coherence, so that they can cooperate with each other in the support of the broad general principles, of the party platform, the election is merely a mockery, no decision is made at the polls, and there is no representation of the popular will. Common honesty and good faith with the people who support a party at the polls require that party, when it enters office, to assume the control of that portion of the Government to which it has been elected. Any other course is bad faith and a violation of the party pledges When the country has bestowed its confidence upon a party by making it a majority in the Congress, it has a right to expect such unity of action as will make the party majority an effective instrument of government. This Administration has come into power with a very clear and definite mandate from the people. The expression of the popular will in favor of maintaining our constitutional guarantees was overwhelming and decisive. There was a manifestation of such faith in the integrity of the courts that we can consider that issue rejected for some time to come. Likewise, the policy of public ownership of railroads and certain electric utilities met with unmistakable defeat. The people declared that they wanted their rights to have not a political but a judicial determination, and their independence and freedom continued and supported by having the ownership and control of their property, not in the Government, but in their own hands. As they always do when they have a fair chance, the people demonstrated that they are sound and are determined to have a sound government When we turn from what was rejected to inquire what was accepted, the policy that stands out with the greatest clearness is that of economy in public expenditure with reduction and reform of taxation. The principle involved in this effort is that of conservation. The resources of this country are almost beyond computation. No mind can comprehend them. But the cost of our combined governments is likewise almost beyond definition. Not only those who are now making their tax returns, but those who meet the enhanced cost of existence in their monthly bills, know by hard experience what this great burden is and what it does. No matter what others may want, these people want a drastic economy. They are opposed to waste. They know that extravagance lengthens the hours and diminishes the rewards of their labor. I favor the policy of economy, not because I wish to save money, but because I wish to save people. The men and women of this country who toil are the ones who bear the cost of the Government. Every dollar that we carelessly waste means that their life will be so much the more meager. Every dollar that we prudently save means that their life will be so much the more abundant. Economy is idealism in its most practical form If extravagance were not reflected in taxation, and through taxation both directly and indirectly injuriously affecting the people, it would not be of so much consequence. The wisest and soundest method of solving our tax problem is through economy. Fortunately, of all the great nations this country is best in a position to adopt that simple remedy. We do not any longer need wartime revenues. The collection of any taxes which are not absolutely required, which do not beyond reasonable doubt contribute to the public welfare, is only a species of legalized larceny. Under this republic the rewards of industry belong to those who earn them. The only constitutional tax is the tax which ministers to public necessity. The property of the country belongs to the people of the country. Their title is absolute. They do not support any privileged class; they do not need to maintain great military forces; they ought not to be burdened with a great array of public employees. They are not required to make any contribution to Government expenditures except that which they voluntarily assess upon themselves through the action of their own representatives. Whenever taxes become burdensome a remedy can be applied by the people; but if they do not act for themselves, no one can be very successful in acting for them The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction, when, unless we wish to hamper the people in their right to earn a living, we must have tax reform. The method of raising revenue ought not to impede the transaction of business; it ought to encourage it. I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong. We  cannot finance the country, we  cannot improve social conditions, through any system of injustice, even if we attempt to inflict it upon the rich. Those who suffer the most harm will be the poor. This country believes in prosperity. It is absurd to suppose that it is envious of those who are already prosperous. The wise and correct course to follow in taxation and all other economic legislation is not to destroy those who have already secured success but to create conditions under which every one will have a better chance to be successful. The verdict of the country has been given on this question. That verdict stands. We shall do well to heed it These questions involve moral issues. We need not concern ourselves much about the rights of property if we will faithfully observe the rights of persons. Under our institutions their rights are supreme. It is not property but the right to hold property, both great and small, which our Constitution guarantees. All owners of property are charged with a service. These rights and duties have been revealed, through the conscience of society, to have a divine sanction. The very stability of our society rests upon production and conservation. For individuals or for governments to waste and squander their resources is to deny these rights and disregard these obligations. The result of economic dissipation to a nation is always moral decay These policies of better international understandings, greater economy, and lower taxes have contributed largely to peaceful and prosperous industrial relations. Under the helpful influences of restrictive immigration and a protective tariff, employment is plentiful, the rate of pay is high, and wage earners are in a state of contentment seldom before seen. Our transportation systems have been gradually recovering and have been able to meet all the requirements of the service. Agriculture has been very slow in reviving, but the price of cereals at last indicates that the day of its deliverance is at hand We are not without our problems, but our most important problem is not to secure new advantages but to maintain those which we already possess. Our system of government made up of three separate and independent departments, our divided sovereignty composed of Nation and State, the matchless wisdom that is enshrined in our Constitution, all these need constant effort and tireless vigilance for their protection and support In a republic the first rule for the guidance of the citizen is obedience to law. Under a despotism the law may be imposed upon the subject. He has no voice in its making, no influence in its administration, it does not represent him. Under a free government the citizen makes his own laws, chooses his own administrators, which do represent him. Those who want their rights respected under the Constitution and the law ought to set the example themselves of observing the Constitution and the law. While there may be those of high intelligence who violate the law at times, the barbarian and the defective always violate it. Those who disregard the rules of society are not exhibiting a superior intelligence, are not promoting freedom and independence, are not following the path of civilization, but are displaying the traits of ignorance, of servitude, of savagery, and treading the way that leads back to the jungle The essence of a republic is representative government. Our Congress represents the people and the States. In all legislative affairs it is the natural collaborator with the President. In spite of all the criticism which often falls to its lot, I do not hesitate to say that there is no more independent and effective legislative body in the world. It is, and should be, jealous of its prerogative. I welcome its cooperation, and expect to share with it not only the responsibility, but the credit, for our common effort to secure beneficial legislation These are some of the principles which America represents. We have not by any means put them fully into practice, but we have strongly signified our belief in them. The encouraging feature of our country is not that it has reached its destination, but that it has overwhelmingly expressed its determination to proceed in the right direction. It is true that we could, with profit, be less sectional and more national in our thought. It would be well if we could replace much that is only a false and ignorant prejudice with a true and enlightened pride of race. But the last election showed that appeals to class and nationality had little effect. We were all found loyal to a common citizenship. The fundamental precept of liberty is toleration. We  cannot permit any inquisition either within or without the law or apply any religious test to the holding of office. The mind of America must be forever free It is in such contemplations, my fellow countrymen, which are not exhaustive but only representative, that I find ample warrant for satisfaction and encouragement. We should not let the much that is to do obscure the much which has been done. The past and present show faith and hope and courage fully justified. Here stands our country, an example of tranquillity at home, a patron of tranquillity abroad. Here stands its Government, aware of its might but obedient to its conscience. Here it will continue to stand, seeking peace and prosperity, solicitous for the welfare of the wage earner, promoting enterprise, developing waterways and natural resources, attentive to the intuitive counsel of womanhood, encouraging education, desiring the advancement of religion, supporting the cause of justice and honor among the nations. America seeks no earthly empire built on blood and force. No ambition, no temptation, lures her to thought of foreign dominions. The legions which she sends forth are armed, not with the sword, but with the cross. The higher state to which she seeks the allegiance of all mankind is not of human, but of divine origin. She cherishes no purpose save to merit the favor of Almighty God.']"

There's the big bombardment on our right\r\nRumbling and bumping; and the dark's a glare\r\nOf flickering horror in the sectors where\r\nWe raid the Boche; men waiting, stiff and chilled,\r\nOr crawling on their bellies through the wire.\r\n\"What? Stretcher-bearers wanted? Some one killed?\"\r\nFive minutes ago I heard a sniper fire:\r\nWhy did he do it? ... Starlight overhead - \r\nBlank stars. I'm wide-awake; and some chap's dead.",

GOD! HOW CLOSE THAT MISSED!\n\r\n A nice polite reminder that the Boche are nigh;\r\n That we're here to fight like devils, and if need-be die;\r\n That from kissing pretty wenches to the frantic firing-benches\r\n Of the battered, tattered trenches is a far, far cry.\r\n Yet still I'm sitting dreaming in the glare and grime;\r\n And once again I'm hearing of them church-bells chime;\r\n And how I wonder whether in the golden summer weather\r\n We will fetch the cows together when it's milking time. . . .\r\n(English voice, months later): - \r\n \"OW BILL!

          "My song is of that city which\r\nHas men too poor and men too rich;\r\nWhere some are sick, too richly fed,\r\nWhile others take the sparrows' bread:\r\nWhere some have beds to warm their bones,\r\nWhile others sleep on hard, cold stones\r\nThat suck away their bodies' heat.\r\nWhere men are drunk in every street;\r\nMen full of poison, like those flies\r\nThat still attack the horses' eyes.\r\nWhere some men freeze for want of cloth,\r\nWhile others show their jewels' worth\r\nAnd dress in satin, fur or silk;\r\nWhere fine rich ladies wash in milk,\r\nWhile starving mothers have no food\r\nTo make them fit in flesh and blood;\r\nSo that their watery breasts can give\r\nTheir babies milk and make them live.\r\nWhere one man does the work of four,\r\nAnd dies worn out before his hour;\r\nWhile some seek work in vain, and grief\r\nDoth make their fretful lives as brief.\r\nWhere ragged men are seen to wait\r\nFor charity that's small and late;\r\nWhile others haunt in idle leisure,\r\nTheatre doors to pay for pleasure.\r\nNo more I'll walk those crowded places\r\nAnd take hot dreams from harlots' faces;\r\nI'll know no more those passions' dreams,\r\nWhile musing near these quiet streams;\r\nThat biting state of savage lust\r\nWhich, true love absent, burns to dust.\r\nGold's rattle shall not rob my ears\r\nOf this sweet music of the spheres.\r\nI'll walk abroad with fancy free;\r\nEach leafy, summer's morn I'll see\r\nThe trees, all legs or bodies, when\r\nThey vary in their shapes like men.\r\nI'll walk abroad and see again\r\nHow quiet pools are pricked by rain;\r\nAnd you shall hear a song as sweet\r\nAs when green leaves and raindrops meet.\r\nI'll hear the Nightingale's fine mood,\r\nRattling with thunder in the wood,\r\nMade bolder by each mighty crash;\r\nWho drives her notes with every flash\r\nOf lightning through the summer's night.\r\nNo more I'll walk in that pale light\r\nThat shows the homeless man awake,\r\nRagged and cold; harlot and rake,\r\nThat have their hearts in rags, and die\r\nBefore that poor wretch they pass by.\r\nNay, I have found a life so fine\r\nThat every moment seems divine;\r\nBy shunning all those pleasures full,\r\nThat bring repentance cold and dull.\r\nSuch misery seen in days gone by,\r\nThat, made a coward, now I fly\r\nTo green things, like a bird. Alas!\r\nIn days gone by I could not pass\r\nTen men but what the eyes of one\r\nWould burn me for no kindness done;\r\nAnd wretched women I passed by\r\nSent after me a moan or sigh.\r\nAh, wretched days: for in that place\r\nMy soul's leaves sought the human face,\r\nAnd not the Sun's for warmth and light, \r\nAnd so was never free from blight.\r\nBut seek me now, and you will find\r\nMe on some soft green bank reclined;\r\nWatching the stately deer close by,\r\nThat in a great deep hollow lie\r\nShaking their tails with all the ease\r\nThat lambs can. First, look for the trees,\r\nThen, if you seek me, find me quick.\r\nSeek me no more where men are thick,\r\nBut in green lanes where I can walk\r\nA mile, and still no human folk\r\nTread on my shadow.

I walk\r\nAnd hear more birds than people talk;\r\nI hear the birds that sing unseen,\r\nOn boughs now smothered with leaves green;\r\nI sit and watch the swallows there,\r\nMaking a circus in the air;\r\nThat speed around straight-going crow,\r\nAs sharks around a ship can go;\r\nI hear the skylark out of sight,\r\nHid perfectly in all this light.\r\nThe dappled cows in fields I pass,\r\nUp to their bosoms in deep grass;\r\nOld oak trees, with their bowels gone,\r\nI see with spring's green finery on.\r\nI watch the buzzing bees for hours,\r\nTo see them rush at laughing flowers, \r\nAnd butterflies that lie so still.\r\nI see great houses on the hill,\r\nWith shining roofs; and there shines one,\r\nIt seems that heaven has dropped the sun.\r\nI see yon cloudlet sail the skies,\r\nRacing with clouds ten times its size.\r\nI walk green pathways, where love waits\r\nTo talk in whispers at old gates;\r\nPast stiles, on which I lean, alone, \r\nCarved with the names of lovers gone;\r\nI stand on arches whose dark stones\r\nCan turn the wind's soft sighs to groans.\r\nI hear the Cuckoo when first he\r\nMakes this green world's discovery,\r\nAnd re-creates it in my mind,\r\nProving my eyes were growing blind.\r\nI see the rainbow come forth clear\r\nAnd wave her coloured scarf to cheer\r\nThe sun long swallowed by a flood, \r\nSo do I live in lane and wood.\r\nLet me look forward to each spring\r\nAs eager as the birds that sing;\r\nAnd feed my eyes on spring's young flowers\r\nBefore the bees by many hours,\r\nMy heart to leap and sing her praise\r\nBefore the birds by many days.\r\nGo white my hair and skin go dry, \r\nBut let my heart a dewdrop lie\r\nInside those leaves when they go wrong,\r\nAs fresh as when my life was young.\n\n",

          "There were not many at that lonely place,\r\nWhere two scourged hills met in a little plain.\r\nThe wind cried loud in gusts, then low again.\r\nThree pines strained darkly, runners in a race\r\nUnseen by any.

glittering, intent\r\nTheir hoarded looks\r\nUpon his merchandise,\r\nAs though it were some splendid cloth\r\nOr sumptuous raiment\r\nStitched in gold and red...\n\r\nHe seldom talks\r\nSave of the goods he spreads - \r\nThe meager cotton with its dismal flower - \r\nBut with his skinny hands\r\nThat hover like two hawks\r\nAbove some luscious meat,\r\nHe fingers lovingly each calico,\r\nAs though it were a gorgeous shawl,\r\nOr costly vesture\r\nWrought in silken thread,\r\nOr strange bright carpet\r\nMade for sandaled feet...\n\r\nHere an old grey scholar stands.\r\nHis brooding eyes - \r\nThat hold long vistas without end\r\nOf caravans and trees and roads,\r\nAnd cities dwindling in remembrance - \r\nBend mostly on his tapes and thread.\n\r\nWhat if they tweak his beard - \r\nThese raw young seed of Israel\r\nWho have no backward vision in their eyes - \r\nAnd mock him as he sways\r\nAbove the sunken arches of his feet - \r\nThey find no peg to hang their taunts upon.\r\nHis soul is like a rock\r\nThat bears a front worn smooth\r\nBy the coarse friction of the sea,\r\nAnd, unperturbed, he keeps his bitter peace.\n\r\nWhat if a rigid arm and stuffed blue shape,\r\nBacked by a nickel star\r\nDoes prod him on,\r\nTaking his proud patience for humility...\r\nAll gutters are as one\r\nTo that old race that has been thrust\r\nFrom off the curbstones of the world...\r\nAnd he smiles with the pale irony\r\nOf one who holds\r\nThe wisdom of the Talmud stored away\r\nIn his mind's lavender.\n\r\nBut this young trader,\r\nBorn to trade as to a caul,\r\nPeddles the notions of the hour.\r\nThe gestures of the craft are his\r\nAnd all the lore\r\nAs when to hold, withdraw, persuade, advance...\r\nAnd be it gum or flags,\r\nOr clean-all or the newest thing in tags,\r\nDemand goes to him as the bee to flower.\r\nAnd he -

\r\nA tape-ruled vision,\r\nCircumscribed in stone - \r\nSome fifty stories to the skies.\n\r\nV\n\r\nAs I sit in my little fifth-floor room - \r\nBare,\r\nSave for bed and chair,\r\nAnd coppery stains\r\nLeft by seeping rains\r\nOn the low ceiling\r\nAnd green plaster walls,\r\nWhere when night falls\r\nGolden lady-bugs\r\nCome out of their holes,\r\nAnd roaches, sepia-brown, consort...\r\nI hear bells pealing\r\nOut of the gray church at Rutgers street,\r\nHolding its high-flung cross above the Ghetto,\r\nAnd, one floor down across the court,\r\nThe parrot screaming:\r\nVorw'rts... Vorw'rts...\n\r\nThe parrot frowsy-white,\r\nEverlastingly swinging\r\nOn its iron bar.\n\r\nA little old woman,\r\nWith a wig of smooth black hair\r\nGummed about her shrunken brows,\r\nComes sometimes on the fire escape.\r\nAn old stooped mother,\r\nThe left shoulder low\r\nWith that uneven droopiness that women know\r\nWho have suckled many young...\r\nYet I have seen no other than the parrot there.\n\r\nI watch her mornings as she shakes her rugs\r\nFeebly, with futile reach\r\nAnd fingers without clutch.\r\nHer thews are slack\r\nAnd curved the ruined back\r\nAnd flesh empurpled like old meat,\r\nYet each conspires\r\nTo feed those guttering fires\r\nWith which her eyes are quick.\n\r\nOn Friday nights\r\nHer candles signal\r\nInfinite fine rays\r\nTo other windows,\r\nCoupling other lights,\r\nLinking the tenements\r\nLike an endless prayer.\n\r\nShe seems less lonely than the bird\r\nThat day by day about the dismal house\r\nScreams out his frenzied word...\r\nThat night by night - \r\nIf a dog yelps\r\nOr a cat yawls\r\nOr a sick child whines,\r\nOr a door screaks on its hinges,\r\nOr a man and woman fight - \r\nSends his cry above the huddled roofs:\r\nVorw'rts...

And the Committee flings him a waste glance,\r\nDropping a leaflet by his plate.\n\r\nA lone fire flickers in the dusty eyes.\r\nThe lips chant inaudibly.\r\nThe warped shrunken body straightens like a tree.\r\nAnd he curses...\r\nWith uplifted arms and perished fingers,\r\nClaw-like, clutching...\r\nSo centuries ago\r\nThe old men cursed Acosta,\r\nWhen they, prophetic, heard upon their sepulchres\r\nThose feet that may not halt nor turn aside for ancient things.\n\r\nVII\n\r\nHere in this room, bare like a barn,\r\nEgos gesture one to the other - \r\nNaked, unformed, unwinged\r\nEgos out of the shell,\r\nExamining, searching, devouring - \r\nAvid alike for the flower or the dung...\r\n(Having no dainty antennae for the touch and withdrawal - \r\nOnly the open maw...)\n\r\nEgos cawing,\r\nExpanding in the mean egg...\r\nLittle squat tailors with unkempt faces,\r\nPale as lard,\r\nFur-makers, factory-hands, shop-workers,\r\nNews-boys with battling eyes\r\nAnd bodies yet vibrant with the momentum of long runs,\r\nHere and there a woman...\n\r\nWords, words, words,\r\nPattering like hail,\r\nLike hail falling without aim...\r\nEgos rampant,\r\nScreaming each other down.\r\nOne motions perpetually,\r\nWaving arms like overgrowths.\r\nHe has burning eyes and a cough\r\nAnd a thin voice piping\r\nLike a flute among trombones.\n\r\nOne, red-bearded, rearing\r\nA welter of maimed face bashed in from some old wound,\r\nGarbles Max Stirner.\r\nHis words knock each other like little wooden blocks.\r\nNo one heeds him,\r\nAnd a lank boy with hair over his eyes\r\nPounds upon the table.\r\n - He is chairman.\n\r\nEgos yet in the primer,\r\nHearing world-voices\r\nChanting grand arias...\r\nMajors resonant,\r\nStunning with sound...\r\nBaffling minors\r\nHalf-heard like rain on pools...\r\nMajestic discordances\r\nGreater than harmonies...\r\n - Gleaning out of it all\r\nPassion, bewilderment, pain...\n\r\nEgos yearning with the world-old want in their eyes - \r\nHurt hot eyes that do not sleep enough...\r\nStriving with infinite effort,\r\nFrustrate yet ever pursuing\r\nThe great white Liberty,\r\nTrailing her dissolving glory over each hard-won barricade - \r\nOnly to fade anew...\n\r\nEgos crying out of unkempt deeps\r\nAnd waving their dreams like flags - \r\nMulti-colored dreams,\r\nWinged and glorious...\n\r\nA gas jet throws a stunted flame,\r\nVaguely illumining the groping faces.\r\nAnd through the uncurtained window\r\nFalls the waste light of stars,\r\nAs cold as wise men's eyes...\r\nIndifferent great stars,\r\nFortuitously glancing\r\nAt the secret meeting in this shut-in room,\r\nBare as a manger.\n\r\nVIII\n\r\nLights go out\r\nAnd the stark trunks of the factories\r\nMelt into the drawn darkness,\r\nSheathing like a seamless garment.\n\r\nAnd mothers take home their babies,\r\nWaxen and delicately curled,\r\nLike little potted flowers closed under the stars.\n\r\nLights go out\r\nAnd the young men shut their eyes,\r\nBut life turns in them...\n\r\nLife in the cramped ova\r\nTearing and rending asunder its living cells...\r\nWars, arts, discoveries, rebellions, travails, immolations, cataclysms, hates...\r\nPent in the shut flesh.\r\nAnd the young men twist on their beds in languor and dizziness unsupportable...\r\nTheir eyes - heavy and dimmed\r\nWith dust of long oblivions in the gray pulp behind - \r\nStaring as through a choked glass.\r\nAnd they gaze at the moon - throwing off a faint heat - \r\nThe moon, blond and burning, creeping to their cots\r\nSoftly, as on naked feet...\r\nLolling on the coverlet... like a woman offering her white body.\n\r\nNude glory of the moon!\r\nThat leaps like an athlete on the bosoms of the young girls stripped of their linens;\r\nStroking their breasts that are smooth and cool as mother-of-pearl\r\nTill the nipples tingle and burn as though little lips plucked at them.\r\nThey shudder and grow faint.\r\nAnd their ears are filled as with a delirious rhapsody,\r\nThat Life, like a drunken player,\r\nStrikes out of their clear white bodies\r\nAs out of ivory keys.\n\r\nLights go out...\r\nAnd the great lovers linger in little groups, still passionately debating,\r\nOr one may walk in silence, listening only to the still summons of Life -

\r\nLittle oval mirrors like tiny pools.\r\nHe shuffles up a darkened street\r\nAnd the moon burnishes his mirrors till they shine like phosphorus...\r\nThe moon like a skull,\r\nStaring out of eyeless sockets at the old men trundling home the pushcarts.\n\r\nIX\n\r\nA sallow dawn is in the sky\r\nAs I enter my little green room.\r\nSadie's light is still burning...\r\nWithout, the frail moon\r\nWorn to a silvery tissue,\r\nThrows a faint glamour on the roofs,\r\nAnd down the shadowy spires\r\nLights tip-toe out...\r\nSoftly as when lovers close street doors.\n\r\nOut of the Battery\r\nA little wind\r\nStirs idly - as an arm\r\nTrails over a boat's side in dalliance - \r\nRippling the smooth dead surface of the heat,\r\nAnd Hester street,\r\nLike a forlorn woman over-born\r\nBy many babies at her teats,\r\nTurns on her trampled bed to meet the day.\n\n\r\nLIFE!\r\nStartling, vigorous life,\r\nThat squirms under my touch,\r\nAnd baffles me when I try to examine it,\r\nOr hurls me back without apology.\r\nLeaving my ego ruffled and preening itself.\n\r\nLife,\r\nArticulate, shrill,\r\nScreaming in provocative assertion,\r\nOr out of the black and clotted gutters,\r\nPiping in silvery thin\r\nSweet staccato\r\nOf children's laughter,\n\r\nOr clinging over the pushcarts\r\nLike a litter of tiny bells\r\nOr the jingle of silver coins,\r\nPerpetually changing hands,\r\nOr like the Jordan somberly\r\nSwirling in tumultuous uncharted tides,\r\nSurface-calm.\n\r\nElectric currents of life,\r\nThrowing off thoughts like sparks,\r\nGlittering, disappearing,\r\nMaking unknown circuits,\r\nOr out of spent particles stirring\r\nFeeble contortions in old faiths\r\nPassing before the new.\n\r\nLong nights argued away\r\nIn meeting halls\r\nBack of interminable stairways - \r\nIn Roumanian wine-shops\r\nAnd little Russian tea-rooms...\n\r\nFeet echoing through deserted streets\r\nIn the soft darkness before dawn...\r\nBrows aching, throbbing, burning - \r\nLife leaping in the shaken flesh\r\nLike flame at an asbestos curtain.\n\r\nLife - \r\nPent, overflowing\r\nStoops and fa'ades,\r\nJostling, pushing, contriving,\r\nSeething as in a great vat...\n\r\nBartering, changing, extorting,\r\nDreaming, debating, aspiring,\r\nAstounding, indestructible\r\nLife of the Ghetto...\n\r\nStrong flux of life,\r\nLike a bitter wine\r\nOut of the bloody stills of the world...\r\nOut of the Passion eternal.",

They have broacht\r\nThe wine that had pleas'd God to flocking thirst\r\nOf flies and wasps, to fears and worldly sorrows.\r\nNay, they are poured out into the dung of the world,\r\nAnd drench, pollute, the fortune of their state,\r\nWhen they should have no fortune but themselves\r\nAnd the God in them, and be sealed therein.\r\nAh, my sweet soul, that knoweth its own sweetness,\r\nWhere only love may drink, and only - alas! - \r\nThe ghost of love. But I am sweet for him,\r\nFor him and God, and for my sacred self!\r\nBut hark, a troop of new woe comes this way,\r\nMaking the street to ring and the stones wet\r\nWith cried despair and brackish agony.\n\r\nCITIZENS lamenting in the street below.\r\nThey have crawled back like beasts dying of thirst,\r\nThe life all clotted in them. They went out\r\nSoldiers, and back like beaten dogs they came\r\nBreathing in whines, slow maimed four-footed things\r\nOn hands and knees degraded, groaning steps.\r\nTheir brains were full of battle, they were made\r\nOf virtue, brave men; now in their brains shudder\r\nMinds that cringe like children burnt with fever.\r\nOften they stood to face the enemies' ranks\r\nAll upright as a flame in windless air,\r\nWearing their arm and the bright skill of swords\r\nLike spirits clad in flashing fire of heaven;\r\nAnd now in darken'd rooms they lie afraid\r\nAnd whimper if the nurse moves suddenly. - \r\nAh God, that such an irresistible fiend,\r\nPain, in the beautiful housing of man's flesh\r\nShould sleep, light as a leopard in its hunger,\r\nBeside the heavenly soul; and at a wound\r\nLeap up to mangle her, the senses' guest! - \r\nThat in God's country heathen men should do\r\nThis worse than murder on men full of God!\n\r\nJudith.\r\nWhat matter of new wailing do your tongues\r\nWear in this shivering misery of sound?\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nThe captains which were chosen to go out\r\nAnd treat with Holofernes have come back.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nAnd did the Ninevite demon treat with them?\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nThe words they had from him were flaying knives,\r\nAnd burning splinters fixt in their skinless flesh,\r\nAnd stones thrown till their breasts were broken in.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nWhat, torture our embassage?\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nYea, for he means\r\nNothing but death to all the Jews he takes.\n\r\nAnother.\r\nThere was a jeering word tied round the neck\r\nOf each tormented man: \"Behold, ye Jews,\r\nThese chiefs of yours have learnt to crawl in prayer\r\nBefore the god Nebuchadnezzar; come,\r\nLeave your city of thirst and your weak god,\r\nAnd learn good worship even as these have learnt.\"\n\r\nAnother.\r\nI saw them coming in: O horrible!\r\nWith broken limbs creeping along the ground - \n\r\nJudith.\r\nWere I a man among you, I would not stay\r\nBehind the walls to weep this insolence;\r\nI'ld take a sword in my hand and God in my mind,\r\nAnd seek under the friendship of the night\r\nThat tent where Holofernes' crimes and hate\r\nSleep in his devilish brain.\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nThere is no night\r\nWhere Holofernes sleeps, as thou couldst tell.\r\nDidst thou not shut thyself up in thine ease\r\nAway from the noise and tears of common woe.\r\nCome to the walls this evening, and I'll show thee\r\nThe golden place of light, the little world\r\nOf triumphing glory framed in midst of the dark,\r\nPillar'd on four great bonfires fed with spice,\r\nEnclosing in a globe of flame the tent\r\nWherein the sleepless lusts of Holofernes\r\nMadden themselves all night, a revel-rout\r\nOf naked girls luring him as he lies\r\nFilling his blood with wine, the scented air\r\nInjur'd marvellously with piping shrills\r\nOf lechery made music, and small drums\r\nThat with a dancing throb drive his swell'd heart\r\nInto desires beyond the strength of man.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nAnd this beast is thine enemy, God!\n\r\nAnother Citizen.\r\nNor beast,\r\nNor man, but one of those lascivious gods\r\nOur lonely God detests, Chemosh or Baal\r\nOr Peor who goes whoring among women.\n\r\nAnother.\r\nAnd now come down braving in God's own land,\r\nPitching the glory of his fearful heaven\r\nAll night among God's hills.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nYou fools, he is\r\nA life our God could snap as a woman snaps\r\nThread of her sewing.\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nWho shall break him off,\r\nWho on the earth, from his huge twisted power?\n\r\nAnother.\r\nFor in his brain, as in a burning-glass\r\nWide glow of sun drawn to a pin of fire,\r\nAre gathered into incredible fierceness all\r\nThe rays of the dark heat of heathen strength.\n\r\nAnother.\r\nHis eyes, they say, can kill a man.\n\r\nAnother.\r\nAnd sure\r\nNo murder could approach his naming nights.\n\r\nAnother.\r\nUnless it came as a woman at whose beauty\r\nHis lust hath never sipt; for into his flesh\r\nTo drink unknown desirable limbs as wine\r\nTorments him still, like a thirst when fever pours\r\nA man's life out in drenching sweats.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nPeace, peace;\r\nThe siege hath given you shameless tongues, and minds\r\nNo more your own: yea, the foul Ninevite\r\nHath mastered you already, for your thoughts\r\nDwell in his wickedness and marvel at it.\r\nHate not a thing too much, lest you be drawn\r\nWry from yourselves and close to the thing ye hate.\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nWe know thy wisdom, Judith; but our lives\r\nBelong to death; and wisdom to a man\r\nDying, is water in a broken jar.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nYea, if thou wilt die of a parching mouth.\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nThou art rich, and thou hast much cool store of wine.\r\nBut the town thirsts, and every beat of our blood\r\nHastens us on to maniac agony.\r\nThe Assyrians have our wells, and half the tanks\r\nAre dry, and the pools shoal with baking mud:\r\nThe water left to us is pestilent.\r\nAnd therefore have we asked the governors\r\nFor death: and it is granted us.\n\r\nAnother.\r\nFive days\r\nHath Prince Ozias bidden us endure.\n\r\nAnother.\r\nFor there are still fools among us who dare trust\r\nGod has not made a bargain of our lives.\n\r\nAnother.\r\nWe are a small people, and our war is weak:\r\nWho knows whether our God doth not desire\r\nArmies and great plains full of spears and horses,\r\nAnd cities made of bronze and hewn white stone\r\nAnd scarlet awnings, throng'd with sworded men,\r\nTo shout his name up from the earth and kill\r\nAll crying at the gates of other heavens;\r\nAnd hath grown tired of peaceable praise and folk\r\nThat in a warren of dry mountains dwell,\r\nWhose few throats can make little noise in heaven.\n\r\nA Young Man.\r\nFor sure God's love hath wandered to strange nations;\r\nHis pleasure in the breasts of Jerusalem\r\nIs a delight grown old. Yea, he would change\r\nThat shepherd-woman of the earthly cities,\r\nWhose mind is as the clear light of her hills,\r\nFull of the sound of a hundred waters falling;\r\nAnd poureth his desire out, belike,\r\nUpon that queen the wealth of the world hath clad,\r\nBabylon, for whose golden bed the gods\r\nWrangle like young men with great gifts and boasts;\r\nWhose mind is as a carbuncle of fire,\r\nFull of the sound of amazing flames of music.\n\r\nAnother.\r\nYea, what can Israel offer against her,\r\nWhom the rich earth out of her mines hath shod,\r\nAnd crowned with emeralds grown in secret rocks,\r\nWho on her shoulders wears the gleam of the sea's\r\nPurple and pearls, and the flax of Indian ground\r\nIs linen on her limbs cool as moonlight,\r\nAnd fells of golden beasts cover her throne;\r\nWhose passion moves in her thought as in the air\r\nMelody moves of flutes and silver horns:\r\nWhat can Jerusalem the hill-city\r\nOffer to keep God's love from Babylon?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nWhat but the beauty of holiness, and sound\r\nOf music made by hearts adoring God?\r\nYou that speak lewdly of God, you yet shall see\r\nJerusalem treading upon her foes.\r\nBut what was that of five days one of you spoke?\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nOzias sware an oath: hast thou not heard?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nNo, for I keep my mind away from your tongues\r\nWisely. Who walks in wind-blown dust of streets,\r\nThat hath a garden where the roses breathe?\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nI have no garden where the roses breathe;\r\nI have a city full of women crying\r\nAnd babies starving and men weak with thirst\r\nWho fight each other for a dole of water.\n\r\nAnother.\r\nNot only thou hast pleasant garden-hours,\r\nJudith, here in Bethulia; the Lord Death\r\nHas bought the city for his garden-close,\r\nAnd saunters in it watching the souls bloom\r\nOut of their buds of flesh, and with delight\r\nSmelling their agony.\n\r\nAnother.\r\nBut in five days\r\nEither our God will turn his mind to us,\r\nOr, if he careth not for us nor his honour,\r\nOzias will let open the main gate\r\nAnd let the Assyrians end our dreadful lives.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nO I belong to a nation utterly lost!\r\nGod! thou hast no tribe on the earth; thy folk\r\nAre helpless in the living places like\r\nThe ghosts that grieve in the winds under the earth.\r\nRemember now thy glory among the living,\r\nAnd let the beauty of thy renown endure\r\nIn a firm people knitted like the stone\r\nOf hills, no mischief harms of frost or fire;\r\nBut now dust in a gale of fear they are.\r\nThey have blasphemed thee; but forgive them, God;\r\nAnd let my life inhabit to its end\r\nThe spirit of a people built to God. - \r\nSo you have given God five days to come\r\nAnd help you? You would make your souls as wares\r\nMerchants hold up to bidders, and say, \"God,\r\nPay us our price of comfort, or we sell\r\nTo death for the same coin\"? Five days God hath\r\nTo find the cost of Jewry, or death buys you?\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nHere comes Ozias: ask him.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nHold him there.\n\r\n[JUDITH comes down into the street.]\n\r\nOzias.\r\nJudith, I came to speak with thee.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nAnd I\r\nWould speak with thee. What tale is this they tell\r\nThat thou hast sworn to give this people death?\n\r\nOzias.\r\nIn five days those among us who still live\r\nWill have no souls but the fierce anguish of thirst.\r\nIf God ere then relieves us, well. If not,\r\nWe give ourselves away from God to death.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nDarest thou do this wickedness, and set\r\nConditions to the mercy of our God?\n\r\nOzias.\r\nDeath hath a mercy equal unto God's. - \r\nLook at the air above thee; is there sign\r\nOf mercy in that naked splendour of fire?\r\nToo Godlike! We are his: he covers us\r\nWith golden flame of air and firmament\r\nOf white-hot gold, marvellous to see.\r\nBut whom, what heathen land hated of God,\r\nDo his grey clouds shadow with comfort of rain?\r\nOver our chosen heads his glory glows:\r\nAnd in five days the torment in his city\r\nWill be beyond imagining. We will go\r\nThrough swords into the quiet and cloud of death.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nOzias, wilt thou be an infamy?\r\nBethulia fallen, all Judea lies\r\nOpen to the feet and hoofs of Assyria.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nYea, and what doth Judea but cower down\r\nBehind us? There's no rescue comes from there.\r\nWe are alone with Holofernes' power.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nBut if we hold him off, will he not grant\r\nThe meed of a brave fight, captivity? - \r\nOr we may treat with him, make terms for yielding.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nWe know his mind: he hath written it plain\r\nIn the torn flesh of our ambassadors.\r\nHis mind to us is death; we can but choose\r\nBetween sharp swords and the slow slaying of thirst.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nHe may torment us if we yield.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nHe may.\r\nBut not to yield is grisly and sure torment.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nThere must be hope, if we could reckon right!\n\r\nOzias.\r\nWell, thou and God have five days more to build\r\nA bridge of hope over our broken world.\r\nAnd, for the town even now fearfully aches\r\nIn scalding thirst, not five days had I granted,\r\nHad it not been for somewhat I must say\r\nSecretly to thee.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nSecretly? Then here;\r\nSend off these men to labour at their groans\r\nElsewhere; for not within my house thou comest;\r\nI'll have no thoughts against God in my house.\n\r\n[OZIAS disperses the citizens.]\n\r\nOzias.\r\nJudith, we are two upright minds in this\r\nHerd of grovelling cowardice. We should,\r\nTo spiritual vision which can see\r\nStature of spirit, seem to stand in our folk\r\nLike two unaltered stanchions in the heap\r\nOf a house pulled down by fire. I know thy soul\r\nTempered by trust in God against this ruin;\r\nBut not in God, but in mortality\r\nThy soul stands founded; and death even now\r\nIs digging at thy station in the world;\r\nAnd as a man with ropes and windlasses\r\nPulls for new building columns of wreckt halls\r\nDown with a breaking fall, so death has rigged\r\nHis skill about us, so he will break us down,\r\nRuin our height and courage; and as stone,\r\nCarved with the beautiful pride of kings, hath made,\r\nHammer'd to rubble and ground for mortar, walls\r\nOf farms and byres, our kill'd and broken natures,\r\nWith all their beauty of passion, yea, and delight\r\nIn God, death will shape and grind up to new\r\nHousing for souls not royal as we are,\r\nNew flesh and mind for mean souls and dull hearts:\r\nFor death is only life destroying life\r\nTo roof the coming swarms in mortal shelter\r\nOf flesh and mind experienced in joy.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nThy specious prologue means no good, I trow.\r\nThou wert to tell me wherefore for five days\r\nWe may pretend to be God's people still;\r\nWhy thou didst not make us over to death\r\nSoon as the folk began to wail despair.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nThis reasoning will tell thee why. - No need,\r\nI think, to bring up into speech the years\r\nSince in the barley-field Manasses lay\r\nShot by the sun. I tried (nor failed, I think),\r\nTo hold thy soul up from its hurt, and be\r\nSomewhat of sight to thee, until thy long\r\nBlind season of disaster should be changed.\r\nAlways I have found friendship in thine eyes;\r\nAnd pleasant words, and silences more pleasant,\r\nHave made us moments wherein all the world\r\nLeft our sequester'd minds; so that I dared\r\nOften believe our friendliness might be\r\nThe brink of love.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nStop! for thou hast enough\r\nDisgraced mine ears.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nI pray thee hear me out.\r\nThe dream of loving thee and being loved\r\nHath been my life; yea, with it I have kept\r\nMy heart drugg'd in a long delicious night\r\nColour'd with candles of imagined sense,\r\nAnd musical with dreamt desire. I said,\r\nThe day will surely come upon the world,\r\nTo scatter this sweet night of fantasy\r\nWith morning, pour'd on my dream-feasted heart\r\nOut of thine eyes, Judith. And yet I still\r\nFeared for my dream, even as a maiden fears\r\nThe body of her lover. But, in the midst\r\nOf all this charm'd delaying, - behold Death\r\nLeapt into our world, lording it, standing huge\r\nIn front of the future, looking at us!\r\nThou seest now why, when the people came\r\nCrying wildly to be given up to death,\r\nI bade them wait five days? - That I at last\r\nMight stamp the image of my glorious dream\r\nUpon the world, even though it be wax\r\nAnd the fires are kindling that must melt it out.\r\nJudith, thou hast now five days more to live\r\nThis life of beautiful passion and sweet sense:\r\nAnd now my love comes to thee like an angel\r\nTo call thee out of thy visionary love\r\nFor lost Manasses, out of ghostly desire\r\nAnd shadows of dreams housing thy soul, that are\r\nVainer than mine were, dreams of dear things which death\r\nHath for ever broken; and lead thy life\r\nTo a brief shadowless place, into an hour\r\nMade splendid to affront the coming night\r\nBy passion over sense more grandly burning\r\nThan purple lightning over golden corn,\r\nWhen all the distance of the night resounds\r\nWith the approach of wind and terrible rain,\r\nThat march to torment it down to the ground.\r\nJudith, shall we not thus together make\r\nDeath admirable, yea, and triumph through\r\nThe gates of anguish with a prouder song\r\nThan ever lifted a king's heart, who rode\r\nBack from his war, with nations whipt before him,\r\nInto trumpeting Nineveh?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nThou fool,\r\nDeath is nothing to me, and life is all.\r\nBut what foul wrong have I done to thee, Ozias,\r\nThat thou shouldst go about to put such wrong\r\nInto my life as these defiling words?\n\r\nOzias.\r\nIs it defilement to hear love spoken?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nYes! thou hast soiled me: to know my beauty,\r\nWherewith I loved Manasses, and still love,\r\nHas all these years dwelt in thy heart a dream\r\nOf favourite lust, - O this is foul in my mind.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nI meant not what thou callest lust, but love.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nWhat matters that? Thou hast desired me.\r\nAnd knowing that, I feel my beauty clutch\r\nAbout my soul with a more wicked shame\r\nThan if I lived corrupt with leprosy.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nWilt thou still let the dead have claim on thee?\r\nJudith, wilt thou be married to a grave?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nI am married to my love; and it is vile,\r\nYea, it is burning in me like a sin,\r\nThat when my love was absent, thy desire\r\nShouldst trespass where my love is single lord.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nThis is but superstition. Love belongs\r\nTo living souls. It is a light that kills\r\nShadows and ghosts haunting about the mind.\r\nYea, even now when death glooms so immense\r\nOver the heaven of our being, Love\r\nWould keep us white with day amid the dark\r\nDown-coming of the storm, till the end took us.\r\nAnd joy is never wasted. If we love,\r\nThen although death shall break and bray our flesh,\r\nThe joy of love that thrilled in it shall fly\r\nPast his destruction, subtle as fragrance, strong\r\nAnd uncontrollable as fire, to dwell\r\nIn the careering onward of man's life,\r\nIncreasing it with passion and with sweetness.\r\nDuty is on us therefore that we love\r\nAnd be loved. Wert thou made to set alight\r\nSuch splendour of desire in man, and yet,\r\nFor a grave's sake, keep all thy beauty null,\r\nAnd nothing be of good nor help to thy kind?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nHelp? What help in me?\n\r\nOzias.\r\nTo let go forth\r\nThe joy whereof thy beauty is the sign\r\nInto the mind of man, and be therein\r\nCourage of golden music and loud light\r\nAgainst his enemies, the eternal dark\r\nAnd silence.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nAh, not thus. Yet - could I not help? - \r\nWhy talk we? What thing should I say to thee\r\nTo pierce the pride of lust wrapping thy heart?\r\nHow show thee that, as in maidens unloved\r\nThere is virginity to make their sex\r\nShrink like a wound from eyes of love untimely,\r\nSo in a woman who hath learnt herself\r\nBy her own beauty sacred in the clasp\r\nOf him whom her desire hath sacred made,\r\nThere is a fiercer and more virgin wrath\r\nAgainst all eyes that come desiring her?\n\r\n[A Psalm of many voices strikes their ears, and through the street pass old men chanting, followed and answered by a troop of young men.]\n\r\nChorus: Old Men.\r\nWilt thou not examine our hearts, O Lord God of our strength?\r\nWilt thou still be blindly trying us? Wilt thou not at length\r\nBelieve the crying of our words, that never our knees have bent\r\nTo foreign gods, nor any Jewish mouth or brain hath sent\r\nPrayers to beseech the favour of abominable thrones\r\nWorshipt by the heathen men with furnaces, wounds, and groans?\n\r\nYoung Men.\r\nAnd what good in our lives, strength or delighted glee,\r\nHath God paid to purchase our purity?\r\nThough lust starve in our flesh, still he devises fire\r\nTo prove our lives pure as his fierce desire.\r\nWith huge heathenish tribes roaring exultant here,\r\nJewry fights as maid with a ravisher:\r\nTribes who better than we deal with the gods their lords,\r\nFor they pleasantly sin, yet the gods sharpen and drive their swords.\n\r\nOld Men.\r\nHast thou not tried us enough, Jehovah? Hast thou found any fire\r\nWill draw from our hearts a smoke of burn'd idolatrous desire?\r\nThere is none in us, Lord: no other God in us but thee;\r\nOnly thy fires make our clean souls glitter with agony.\r\nPure we are, pure in our prayers, pure our souls look to thee, Lord;\r\nAnd to be shewn to the world devoured by evil is our reward.\n\r\nYoung Men.\r\nWe whose hearts were alone giving our God renown,\r\n Under the wheels of hell we are fallen down!\r\nFalse the heaven we built, fashion'd of purity;\r\n 'Tis heathen heavens, made out of sin, stand high.\r\nCome, make much of our God! Comfort his ears with song,\r\n Lest his pride the gods with their laughter wrong,\r\nSeeing, huddled as beasts held by a fearful night\r\nFull of lions and hunger, his folk crouch to the heathen might.\n\r\nOld Men.\r\nJehovah, still we refrain from crying to the infamous gates\r\nThat open easily into the heavens thy mind of jealousy hates.\r\nPower is in them: hast thou no power? Wilt thou not beware\r\nLest thy mood now press our minds to venturous despair?\n\r\nYoung Men.\r\nFool'd, fool'd, fool'd are our lives, held by the world in jeer;\r\nWith crazed eyes we behold veils of enormous fear\r\nHiding dreadfully those marvellous gates and stairs\r\nWhere the heathen delighted with sin throng with their prosperous prayers.\n\r\nOld Men.\r\nYea, hung like the front of pestilent winds, thunderous dark before\r\nThe way into the heathen heavens, terrible curtains pour,\r\nWebs of black imagination and woven frenzy of sin;\r\nAnd yet we know power on earth belongs to those within.\n\r\nYoung Men.\r\n Yea, through Jehovah's jealousy,\r\n Burning dimly at last we see\r\n The great brass made like rigid flame,\r\n The gates of the heavens we dare not name.\r\n Take hold of wickedness! Yea, have heart\r\n To tear the darkness of sin apart;\r\n And find, beyond, our comforted sight\r\n Flash full of a glee of fiery light, - \r\n The gods the heathen know through sin,\r\n The gods who give them the world to win!\n\r\nJudith.\r\nThis may I not escape. My world hath need\r\nOf me who still hold God firm in my mind.\r\nIt is no matter if I fail: I must\r\nSend the God in me forth, and yield to him\r\nThe shaping of whatever chance befall. - \r\nOzias! hateful thou hast made thyself\r\nTo me; for thou hast hatefully soiled my beauty,\r\nMy preciousest, given me to attire my soul\r\nFor her long marriage festival of life.\r\nYet I must make request to thee, and thou\r\nMust grant it. When the sun is down to-night,\r\nQuietly set the main gate open: I\r\nWill pass therethrough and treat with Holofernes.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nWhat, wilt thou go to be murdered by these fiends?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nAsk nothing, but do simply my request.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nI will: so thou shalt know the reverent heart\r\nI have for thee, although its worship thou\r\nSo bitterly despisest; but thy will\r\nShall be a sacred thing for me to serve.\r\nThou hast thy dangerous demand, because\r\nIt is thou who askest, it is I who may\r\nGrant it to thee, - this only! Yea, I will send\r\nThy heedless body among risks that thou,\r\nLooking alone at the great shining God\r\nWithin thy mind, seest not; but I see\r\nAnd sicken at them. Yet do I not require\r\nThy purpose; whether thy proud heart must have\r\nThe wound of death from steel that has not toucht\r\nThe peevish misery these Jews call blood;\r\nWhether thy mind is for velvet slavery\r\nIn the desires of some Assyrian lord - \r\nForgive me, Judith! there my love spoke, made\r\nFoolish with injury; and I should be\r\nUnwise to stay here, lest it break the hold\r\nI have it in. I go, and I am humbled.\r\nBut thou shalt have thy asking: the gate is thine.\r\n[He goes.]\n\r\nJudith.\r\nHow can it harm me more, to feel my beauty\r\nRead by man's eyes to mean his lust set forth?\r\nYea, Holofernes now can bring no shame\r\nUpon me that Ozias hath not brought.\r\nBut this is chief: what balance can there be\r\nIn my own hurt against a nation's pining?\r\nGod hath given me beauty, and I may\r\nSnare with it him whose trap now bites my folk.\r\nThere is naught else to think of. Let me go\r\nAnd set those robes in order which best pleased\r\nManasses' living eyes; and let me fill\r\nMy gown with jewels, such as kindle sight,\r\nAnd have some stinging sweetness in my hair. - \r\nManasses, my Manasses, lost to me,\r\nGone where my love can nothing search, and hidden\r\nBehind the vapours of these worldly years,\r\nThe many years between me and thy death;\r\nThine ears are sealed with immortal blessedness\r\nAgainst our miserable din of living;\r\nThrough thy pure sense goeth no soil of grief.\r\nForgive me! for thou hast left me here to be hurt\r\nAnd moved to pity by the dolour of men.\r\nThe garment of my soul is splasht with sorrow,\r\nSorrowful noise and sight; and like to fires\r\nOf venom spat on me, the sorrow eats\r\nThrough the thin robe of sense into my soul.\r\nAnd it is cried against me, this keen anguish,\r\nBy my own people and my God's; - and thou\r\nDidst love them. Therefore thou must needs forgive me,\r\nThat I devise how this my beauty, this\r\nSacred to thy long-dead joy of desire,\r\nMay turn to weapon in the hand of God;\r\nSuch weapon as he hath taken aforetime\r\nTo sword whole nations at a stroke to their knees, - \r\nStorms of the air and hilted fire from heaven,\r\nAnd sightless edge of pestilence hugely swung\r\nDown on the bulk of armies in the night.\r\nSuch weapon in God's hand, and wielded so,\r\nA woman's beauty may be now, I pray;\r\nA pestilence suddenly in this foreign blood,\r\nA blight on the vast growth of Assyrian weed,\r\nA knife to the stem of its main root, the heart\r\nOf Holofernes. God! Let me hew him down,\r\nAnd out of the ground of Israel wither our plague!\n\n\r\nII\n\r\nBEFORE THE TENT OF HOLOFERNES\n\r\nHolofernes.\r\nNight and her admirable stars again!\r\nAnd I again envying her and questioning!\r\nWhat hast thou, Night, achieved, denied to me,\r\nThat maketh thee so full of quiet stars?\r\nWhat beauty has been mingled into thee\r\nSo that thy depth burns with the peace of stars? - \r\nI now with fires of uproarious heat,\r\nExclaiming yellow flames and towering splendour\r\nAnd a huge fragrant smoke of precious woods,\r\nMust build against thy overlooking, Stars,\r\nAnd against thy terrible eternal news\r\nOf Beauty that burns quietly and pure,\r\nA lodge of wild extravagant earthly fire;\r\nEven as under passions of fleshly pleasure\r\nI hide myself from my desiring soul.\n\r\n[Enter Guards with JUDITH.]\n\r\nGuard 1.\n\r\nWe found this woman wandering in the trenches,\r\nAnd calling out, \"Take me to Holofernes,\r\nAssyrians, I am come for Holofernes.\"\n\r\nGuard 2.\n\r\nShe would not, for no words of ours, unveil,\r\nAnd something held us back from handling her.\n\r\nGuard 1.\n\r\nWe think she must be beautiful, although\r\nShe is so stubborn with that veil of hers.\n\r\nGuard 2.\n\r\nWe minded my lord's word, that he be shewn\r\nAll the seized women which are strangely fair.\n\r\nHolofernes.\r\nTake off thy veil.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nI will not.\n\r\nHolofernes.\r\nTake thy veil\r\nFrom off thy face, Jewess, or thou straight goest\r\nTo entertain my soldiers.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nI will not.\n\r\nHolofernes.\r\nAm I to tear it, then?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nMy lord, thou durst not.\n\r\nHolofernes.\r\nHa, there is spirit here. I have the whim,\r\nJewess, almost to believe thee: I dare not!\r\nBut tell me who thou art.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nThat shalt thou know\r\nBefore the night has end.\n\r\nHolofernes.\r\nTake off thy veil.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nAlone for Holofernes am I come.\n\r\nHolofernes.\r\nAnd there is only Holofernes here.\r\nThese fellows are but thoughts of mine; my whole\r\nArmy, that treads down all the earth and breaks\r\nThe banks of fending rivers into marsh,\r\nIs nought but my forth-going imagination.\r\nWhere I am, there is no man else: if I\r\nAppeared before thee in a throng of spears,\r\nI'ld stand alone before thee, girt about\r\nBy powers of my mind made visible.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nFor captured peasants or for captured kings\r\nSuch words would have the right big sound. But I\r\nAm woman, and I hear them not: I say\r\nI will not, before any man but thee,\r\nMake known my face; I am only for thee.\r\nWhen I have thee alone and in thy tent\r\nI will unveil.\n\r\nHolofernes (to the Guards).\r\nWhat! Staring? - Hence, you dogs!\n\n\r\nIII\n\r\nIN THE TENT OF HOLOFERNES\n\r\nHolofernes (alone with Judith).\r\nThou art the woman! Thou hast come to me! - \r\nO not as I thought! not with senses blazing\r\nFar into my deep soul abiding calm\r\nWithin their glory of knowledge, as the vast\r\nOf night behind her outward sense of stars.\r\nNow am I but the place thy beauty brightens,\r\nAnd of myself I have no light of sense\r\nNor certainty of being: I am made\r\nEmpty of all my wont of life before thee,\r\nA vessel where thy splendour may be poured,\r\nAfter the way the great vessel of air\r\nAccepts the morning power of the sun.\r\nNow nothing I have known of me remains,\r\nSave that, within me, far as the world is high\r\nBeneath this dawn that gilds my spirit's air,\r\nSome depth, more inward even than my soul,\r\nTroubles and flashes like the shining sea.\r\nO Jewish woman, if thou knewest all\r\nThe hunger and the tears the punisht world\r\nSuffers by cause of thee, and of my dream\r\nThat thou wert somewhere hidden in mankind!\r\nI could not but obey my dream, and toil\r\nTo break the nations and to sift them fine,\r\nPounding them with my warfare into dust,\r\nAnd searching with my many iron hands\r\nThrough their destruction as through crumbs of marl,\r\nUntil my palms should know the jewel-stone\r\nBetwixt them, the Woman who is Beauty, - \r\nNature so long hath like a miser kept\r\nBuried away from me in this heap of Jews!\r\nNow that we twain might meet, women and men\r\nIn every land where I have felt for thee\r\nHave taken desolation for their home,\r\nCrying against me, - and against thee unknowing.\r\nAh, but I had given over to despair\r\nThe mind in me, I ground the stubborn tribes,\r\nI quarried them like rocks and broke them small\r\nAnd ground them down to flinders and to sands;\r\nBut never gleamed the jewel-stone therein,\r\nNaught but the common flint of earth I found.\r\nAnd in a dreary anger I kept on\r\nAssailing the whole kind of man, because\r\nSome manner of war my soul must needs inhabit.\r\nLike a man making himself in drunken sleep\r\nA king, my soul, drunk with its earthly war,\r\nKept idle all its terrible want of thee,\r\nBelieved itself managing arms with God;\r\nYea, when my trampling hurry through the earth\r\nMade cloudy wind of the light human dust,\r\nI thought myself to move in the dark danger\r\nOf blinding God's own face with blasts of war!\r\nUntil my rage forgot his crime against me,\r\nHis hiding thee, the beauty I had dreamt.\r\nYea and I filled my flesh with furious pleasure,\r\nThat in the noise of it my soul should hear\r\nNo whispering thought of desperate desire.\r\nNevertheless, I knew well that my heart's\r\nSightless imagination lifted his face\r\nContinually awake for news of thee.\r\nBut 'twas infirm and crazy waking, like\r\nAs when a starving sentry, put to guard\r\nThe sleep of a broken soldiery that flees\r\nThrough winter of wild hills from hounding foes,\r\nHath but the pain of frozen wounds, and fear\r\nFeeding on his dark spirit, to watch withal.\r\nAnd lo,\r\nAs suddenly, as blessedly thou comest\r\nNow to my heart's unseeing watch for thee,\r\nAs out of the night behind him into the heart,\r\nDrugg'd senseless with its ache, of that lost soldier\r\nAn arrow leaps, and ere the stab can hurt,\r\nHis frozen waking is the ease of death.\r\nSo I am killed by thee; all the loud pain\r\nOf pleasure that had lockt my heart in life,\r\nWherein with blinded and unhearing face\r\nMy hope of thee yet stood and strained to look\r\nAnd listen for thy coming, - all this life\r\nIs killed before thee; yea, like marvellous death,\r\nSpiritual sense invests my heart's desire;\r\nAnd round the quiet and content thereof,\r\nThe striving hunger of my fleshly sense\r\nFails like a web of hanging cloth in fire. - \r\nTell me now, if thou knowest, why thou hast come!\n\r\nJudith.\r\nSufficeth not for us that I have come? - \r\nLet not unseemly things live in my mouth;\r\nYet I would praise thee as thou praisest me,\r\nBut in a manner that my people use,\r\nThings to approach in song they list not speak.\r\nAnd song, thou knowest, inwrought with chiming strings,\r\nSweetens with sweet delay loving desire:\r\nAlso thine eyes will feed, and thy heart wonder. - \r\n Balkis was in her marble town,\r\n And shadow over the world came down.\r\n Whiteness of walls, towers and piers,\r\n That all day dazzled eyes to tears,\r\n Turned from being white-golden flame,\r\n And like the deep-sea blue became.\r\n Balkis into her garden went;\r\n Her spirit was in discontent\r\n Like a torch in restless air.\r\n Joylessly she wandered there,\r\n And saw her city's azure white\r\n Lying under the great night,\r\n Beautiful as the memory\r\n Of a worshipping world would be\r\n In the mind of a god, in the hour\r\n When he must kill his outward power;\r\n And, coming to a pool where trees\r\n Grew in double greeneries,\r\n Saw herself, as she went by\r\n The water, walking beautifully,\r\n And saw the stars shine in the glance\r\n Of her eyes, and her own fair countenance\r\n Passing, pale and wonderful,\r\n Across the night that filled the pool.\r\n And cruel was the grief that played\r\n With the queen's spirit; and she said:\r\n \"What do I hear, reigning alone?\r\n For to be unloved is to be alone.\r\n There is no man in all my land\r\n Dare my longing understand;\r\n The whole folk like a peasant bows\r\n Lest its look should meet my brows\r\n And be harmed by this beauty of mine.\r\n I burn their brains as I were sign\r\n Of God's beautiful anger sent\r\n To master them with punishment\r\n Of beauty that must pour distress\r\n On hearts grown dark with ugliness.\r\n But it is I am the punisht one.\r\n Is there no man, is there none,\r\n In whom my beauty will but move\r\n The lust of a delighted love;\r\n In whom some spirit of God so thrives\r\n That we may wed our lonely lives?\r\n Is there no man, is there none?\" - \r\n She said, \"I will go to Solomon.\"\n\r\nHolofernes.\r\nI shall not bear it: dreamed, it hath made my life\r\nFail almost, like a storm broken in heaven\r\nBy its internal fire; and now I feel\r\nLove like a dreadful god coming to do\r\nHis pleasure on me, to tear me with his joy\r\nAnd shred my flesh-wove strength with merciless\r\nUtterance through me of inhuman bliss. - \r\nI must have more divinity within me. - \r\nCome to me, slave![Calling out to his attendants.]\n\r\nJudith.\r\nThou callest someone? Alas!\r\nO, where's my veil? - Cry him to stay awhile! - \n\r\nHolofernes.\r\nThou troubled with such whimsy! - But 'tis no one,\r\nA mere sexless thing of mine.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nHe is coming!\r\nI threw my veil - where? - I must bow my face\r\nClose to the ground, or his eyes will find me out;\r\nAnd - O my lord, hold him back with thy voice!\r\n[She has knelt down.]\r\nHold him in doubt to enter a moment, while\r\nI loosen my hair into some manner of safety\r\nAgainst his prying.\n\r\nHolofernes.\r\nSlave, dost thou hear me? Come! - \r\nI marvel, room for such a paltering mood\r\nShould be within thy mind, now so nearly\r\nDeified with the first sense of my love.\r\n[A Eunuch comes in.]\n\r\nHolofernes.\r\nWine! The mightiest wine my sutlers have;\r\nWine with the sun's own grandeur in it, and all\r\nThe wildness of the earth conceiving Spring\r\nFrom the sun's golden lust: wine for us twain!\r\nAnd when thou hast brought it, burn anear my bed\r\nStorax and cassia; and let wealth be found\r\nTo cover my bed with such strife of colour,\r\nCrimson and tawny and purple-inspired gold,\r\nThat eyes beholding it may take therefrom\r\nSplendid imagination of the strife\r\nOf love with love's implacable desire.\n\r\nJudith (still kneeling).\r\nI must lean on thee now, my God! A weight\r\nOf pitiable weakness thou must bear\r\nAnd move as it were thine own strength; tell my heart\r\nHow not to sicken in abomination,\r\nShow me the way to loathe this vile man's rage,\r\nNow close to seize me into the use of his pleasure,\r\nWith the loathing that is terrible delight.\r\nSo that not fainting, but refresht and astonisht\r\nAnd strangely spirited and divinely angry\r\nMy body may arise out of its passion,\r\nOut of being enjoyed by this fiend's flesh.\r\nThen man my arm; then let mine own revenge\r\nUtter thy vengeance, Lord, as speech doth meaning;\r\nYea, with hate empower me to say bravely\r\nThe glittering word that even now thy mind\r\nPurposes, God, - the swift stroke of a falchion!\n\r\nHolofernes.\r\nWoman, beloved, why art thou fixt so long\r\nKneeling and downward crookt, and in thy hair\r\nDarkened? - Ah, thy shoulders urging shape\r\nOf loveliness into thy hair's pouring gleam!\n\r\nJudith.\r\nNeeds must I pray my Jewish God for help\r\nAgainst my bridal joys. For I do fear them.\n\r\nHolofernes.\r\nI also: these are the joys that fear doth own.\n\n\r\nIV\n\r\nAt the Gate of Bethulia. On the walls, on either side of\r\nthe Gate, are citizens watching the Assyrian camp;\r\nOZIAS also, standing by himself.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nWhen wilt thou cure thyself, spirit of the earth,\r\nWhen wilt thou cure thyself of thy long fever,\r\nThat so insanely doth ferment in thee? - \r\n'Tis not man only: the whole blood of life\r\nIs fever'd with desire. But as the brain,\r\nBeing lord of the body, is served by blood\r\nSo well that a hidden canker in the flesh\r\nMay send, continuous as a usury,\r\nIts breeding venom upward, till in the brain\r\nIt vapour into enormity of dreaming:\r\nSo man is lord of life upon the earth;\r\nAnd like a hastening blood his nature wells\r\nUp out of the beasts below him, they the flesh\r\nAnd he the brain, they serving him with blood;\r\nAnd blood so loaden with brute lust of being\r\nIt steams the conscious leisure of man's thought\r\nWith an immense phantasma of desire,\r\nAn unsubduable dream of unknown pleasure;\r\nWhich he sends hungering forth into the world,\r\nBut never satisfied returns to him.\r\nWho hath found beauty? Who hath not desired it?\r\n'Tis but the feverish spirit of earthly life\r\nWorking deliriously in man, a dream\r\nQuesting the world that throngs upon man's mind\r\nTo find therein an image of herself;\r\nAnd there is nothing answers her entreaty. - \r\nI climb towards death: it is not falling down\r\nFor me to die, but up the event of the world\r\nAs up a mighty ridge I climb, and look\r\nWith lifted vision backward down on life.\r\nSo high towards death I am gone, listless I gaze\r\nWhere on the earth beneath me, into the fires\r\nOf that Assyrian strength, our siege of fate,\r\nJudith, the dream of my desire of beauty,\r\nGoes daring forth, to shape herself therein,\r\nSeeking to fashion in its turbulence\r\nSome deed that will be likeness of herself.\r\nFor now I know her purpose: and I know\r\nShe will be murdered there. Against the world\r\nThe beauty I have lived in, my loved dream,\r\nGoes, wild to master the world; and she will\r\nTherefore be murdered. It is nothing now;\r\nWind from the heights of death is on my brow.\n\r\nTalk among the other watchers.\r\nIt must be, God is for us. Such a mind\r\nAs this of Judith's could not be, unless\r\nGod had spoken it into her. She is\r\nHis special voice, to tell the Assyrians\r\nTerrible matters.\n\r\nIs she God's? I think\r\n'Tis Holofernes hath her now.\n\r\nIf not,\r\nUpon his soldiers he hath lavisht her.\n\r\nNot he. Now they have known her, his filled senses\r\nNever will leave go our wonderful Judith.\n\r\nAy, wonderful in Jewry. But there are\r\nIn Babylon women so beautiful,\r\nThey make men's spirits desperate, to know\r\nFlesh cannot ever minister enough\r\nDelight to ease the craving they are taskt with.\n\r\nWho talks of Babylon when God even now\r\nIs training her fierce champion, Holofernes,\r\nInto the death a woman holds before him?\n\r\nA woman killing Holofernes!\n\r\nAy;\r\nBe she abused by him or not, I know\r\nGod means to give her marvellous hands to-night.\r\nI know it by my heart so strangely sick\r\nWith looking out for the first drowsy stir\r\nIn that huge flaming quiet of the camp.\r\nNow fearfuller qualm than famine eagerly\r\nHandles my life and pulls at it, - my faith's\r\nHunger for being fed with sounds and visions:\r\nThe firelight mixt with a trooping bustle of shadows,\r\nThe silence suddenly shouting with surprise,\r\nThat tells of men astounded out of sleep\r\nTo find that God hath dreadfully been among them.\n\r\nWe have mistaken Judith.\n\r\nEven as now\r\nGod is mistaken by your doubting hearts.\n\r\nShe that has dealt with such a pride of spirit\r\nIn all her ways of life, so that she seemed\r\nTo feel like shadow, falling on the light\r\nHer own mind made, the common thoughts of men;\r\nAy, she that to-day came down into our woe\r\nAnd stood among the griefs that buzz upon us,\r\nLike one who is forced aside from a bright journey\r\nTo stoop in a small-room'd cottage, where loud flies\r\nPester the inmates and the windows darken;\r\nThis she, this Judith, out of her quiet pride,\r\nAnd out of her guarded purity, to walk\r\nWhere God himself from violent whoredom could\r\nScarcely preserve her shuddering flesh! and all\r\nFor our sake, for the lives she hath in scorn,\r\nThis horrible Assyrian risk she ventures.\n\r\nThere should be prayer for that. Let us ask God\r\nTo bind the men, whose greed now glares upon her,\r\nIn some strange feebleness; surely he will;\r\nSurely not with woman's worst injury\r\nHer noble obedience he will reward!\r\nLet us ask God to bind these men before her.\n\r\nThey are not his to bind: else, were they here?\r\nThey are the glorying of Nebuchadnezzar's\r\nHeart of fury against our God, sent here\r\nLike insolent shouting into his holy quiet.\r\nGod could not bind these bragging noises up\r\nIn Nebuchadnezzar's heart; it is not his,\r\nBut made by Babylonian gods or owned\r\nBy thrones that hold the heavens over Nineveh.\r\nFor all these outland greatnesses, these kings\r\nWhose war goes pealing through the world, these towns\r\nInfidel and triumphant, reaching forth\r\nArmies to hug the world close to their lust, - \r\nWhat are they but the gods making a scorn\r\nOf our God on the earth? Then how can he\r\nAlter these men from wicked delight? or how\r\nKeep Judith all untoucht among their hands,\r\nWhen his own quietness he could not keep\r\nUnbroken by the god's Assyrian insult?\n\r\nBut with a thunder he can shatter this\r\nIntruding noise, and make his quiet again.\n\r\nAnd in their lust he can entangle them,\r\nDeceiving them far into Judith's beauty,\r\nWhich is his power, and lop them from their gods.\n\r\nTheir outrage will be ornament upon her!\n\r\nOut of the hands of the goblins she will come\r\nNot markt with shame, but wearing their vile usage\r\nLike one whom earthly reign covers with splendour.\n\r\nThe ignominy they thought of shall be turned\r\nTo shining, yea, to announcing through the world\r\nHow God hath used her to beguile the heathen.\r\nIt begins! Now it begins! Lo, how dismay\r\nIs fallen on the camp in a strange wind:\r\nThe ground, that seemed as spread with yellow embers,\r\nLeaps into blazing, and like cinders whirled\r\nAnd scattered up among the flames, are black\r\nBands of frantic men flickering about!\n\r\nOzias! seest thou how our enemies\r\nAre labouring in amazement? How they run\r\nFlinging fuel to light them against fear?\n\r\nNow they begin to roar their terror: now\r\nThey wave and beckon wordless desperate things\r\nOne to another.\n\r\nHear the iron and brass\r\nRinging above their voices, as they snatch\r\nThe arms that seem to fight among themselves,\r\nSeized by their masters' anguish; dost thou hear\r\nThe clumsy terror in the camp, the men\r\nHasting to arm themselves against our God,\r\nOzias?\n\r\nOzias.\r\nLions have taken a sentinel.\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nJudith hath taken Holofernes.\n\r\nJudith's voice outside, under the gate.\r\nYea,\r\nAnd brought him back with her. Open the gates.\n\r\nThe Citizens.\r\nOpen the gates. Bring torches. Wake, ye Jews!\r\nHail, Judith, marvellously chosen woman!\r\nHow bringst thou Holofernes? Show him to us.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nDare you indeed behold him?\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nIs he bound?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nDrugged rather, with a medicine that God\r\nPrepared for him and gave into my hands.\r\nOpen the gates! It is a harmless thing,\r\nThe Holofernes I have made your show;\r\nYou may gaze blithely upon him. I have tamed\r\nThe man's pernicious brain. Open the gates!\r\nWhat, are your hands still nerveless? But my hands,\r\nThe hands of a woman, have done notable work.\n\r\nThe Gates open. JUDITH appears, standing against\r\nthe night and the Assyrian fires. Torches and\r\nshouting in the town.\n\r\nCitizens.\r\nJudith! Judith alone! Where is thy boast\r\nOf Holofernes captured?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nI am alone,\r\nIndeed; and you are many; yet with me\r\nComes Holofernes, certainly a captive.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nWhat trifle is this?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nTrifle? It is the word.\r\nA trifle, a thing of mere weight, I have brought you\r\nFrom the Assyrian camp. My apron here\r\nIs loaded now more heavily, but as meanly\r\nAs an old witch's skirt, when she comes home\r\nFrom seeking camel's-dung for kindling; yet\r\nMy burden was, an hour ago, the world\r\nWhere you were ground to tortures; it was the brain\r\nInventing your destruction. - Look you now!\r\n[Holding up the head of HOLOFERNES.]\r\nThis is the mouth through which commandment came\r\nOf massacre and damnation to the Jews;\r\nHere was the mind the gods that hate our God\r\nUsed to empower the agonies they devised\r\nAgainst us; here your dangers were all made,\r\nYour horrible starvation; and the thirst\r\nThose wicked gods supposed would murder you,\r\nHere a creature became, a ravenous creature;\r\nYea, here those mighty vigours lived which took,\r\nLike ocean water taking frost, the hate\r\nThose gods have for Jehovah, shaping it\r\nAtrociously into the war that clencht\r\nTheir fury about you, frozen into iron.\r\nJews, here is the head of Holofernes: take it\r\nAnd let it grin upon our highest wall\r\nOver against the camp of the Assyrians.\r\n[She throws them the head.]\r\nAy, you may worry it; now is the jackals' time;\r\nSnarl on your enemy, now he is dead.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nJudith, be not too scornful of their noise.\r\nThere are no words may turn this deed to song:\r\nPraise cannot reach it. Only with such din,\r\nUnmeasured yelling exultation, can\r\nAstonishment speak of it. In me, just now,\r\nThought was the figure of a god, firm standing,\r\nA dignity like carved Egyptian stone;\r\nThou like a blow of fire hast splinter'd it;\r\nIt is abroad like powder in a wind,\r\nOr like heapt shingle in a furious tide,\r\nThou having roused the ungovernable waters\r\nMy mind is built amidst, a dangerous tower.\r\nMy spirit therein dwelling, so overwhelmed\r\nIn joy or fear, disturbance without name,\r\nOut of the rivers it is fallen in\r\nCan snatch no substance it may shape to words\r\nAnswerable to thy prowess and thy praise.\r\nWe are all abasht by thee, and only know\r\nTo worship thee with shouts and astounded passion.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nYes, now the world has got a voice against me:\r\nAt last now it may howl a triumph about me.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nThis, nevertheless, my thought can seize from out\r\nThe wildness that goes pouring past it. God,\r\nWondrously having moved thee to this deed,\r\nHath shown the Jews a wondrous favouring love.\r\nThee it becomes not, standing though thou art\r\nOn this high action, to think scorn of men\r\nWhom God thinks worthy of having thee for saviour.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nThis is a subtle flattery. What know I\r\nOf whom God loves, of whom God hates? I know\r\nThis only: in my home, in my soul's chamber,\r\nA filthy verminous beast hath made his lair.\r\nI let him in; I let this grim lust in;\r\nNot only did not bolt my doors against\r\nHis forcing, but even put them wide and watcht\r\nHim coming in, to make my house his stable.\r\nWhat though I killed him afterward? All my place,\r\nAnd all the air I live in, is foul with him.\r\nI killed him? Truly, I am mixt with him;\r\nDeath must have me before it hath all him.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nIn thee, too, are the floods, the wild rivers,\r\nOverrunning thy thought, the nameless mind?\r\nHow else, indeed? Nay, we are dull with joy:\r\nOf thee we thought not, out of the hands of outrage\r\nComing back, although with victory coming.\r\nBut this makes surety once more of my thought,\r\nAnd gives again my reason its lost station;\r\nFor it may come now in my privilege\r\n(A thing that could cure madness in my brain)\r\nThat thou from me persuasion hast to endure\r\nWhat well I know thy soul, thy upright soul,\r\nFeels as abominable harness on it\r\nFastening thee unwillingly to crime, - \r\nThe wickedness that hath delighted in thee.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nAy? Art thou there already? Tasting, art thou,\r\nWhat the Assyrians may have forced on me,\r\nEre thou hast well swallowed thy new freedom?\r\nIndeed, I know this is the wine of the feast\r\nWhich I have set for thee and thy Bethulia;\r\nAnd 'tis the wine makes delicate the banquet.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nWait: listen to me. 'Tis I now must be wise\r\nAnd thou the hearkener. Not without wound\r\n(So I make out, at least, thy hurrying words)\r\nComest thou back to us from conquering.\r\nAnd such a wound, I easily believe,\r\nAs eats into thy soul and rages there;\r\nYea, I that know thee, Judith, know thy soul\r\nWorse rankling hath in it from heathen insult\r\nThan flesh could take from steel bathed in a venom\r\nArt magic brewed over a charcoal fire,\r\nBlown into flame by hissing of whipt lizards.\r\nYet is it likely, by too much regarding,\r\nThy hurt is pamper'd in its poisonous sting.\r\nWounds in the spirit need no surgery\r\nBut a mind strong not to insist on them.\r\nSee, then, thou hast not too much horror of this;\r\nWho that fights well in battle comes home sound? - \r\nMuch less couldst thou, who must, with seeming weakness,\r\nInvite the power of Holofernes forth\r\nEre striking it, thy womanhood the ambush.\r\nFor thou didst plan, I guess, to duel him\r\nIn snares, weaving his greed about his limbs,\r\nDrawn out and twisted winding round his strength\r\nBy ministry of thy enticing beauty;\r\nThat when he thought himself spending on thee\r\nMalicious violence, and thou hadst made him\r\nLanguish, stupid with boasting and delight,\r\nThy hands might find him a tied quiet victim\r\nUnder their anger, maiming him of life.\r\nNow, thy device accomplisht, wilt thou grudge\r\nIts means? Wilt thou scruple to understand\r\nThy abus'd sex will show upon thy fame\r\nA nobler colour of glory than a soldier's\r\nWounded bravery rusting his habergeon?\r\nNay, will not the world rejoice, thou being found\r\nAmong its women, ready such insolence\r\nTo bear as is unbearable to think on,\r\nThereby to serve and save God and his people?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nThe world rejoice over me? Yea, I am certain.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nThen art thou too fastidious. It is weak\r\nTo make thyself a shame of being injured;\r\nAnd is it injury indeed? Nay, is it\r\nAnything but a mere opinion hurt?\r\nNot thou, but customary thought is here\r\nMolested and annoyed; the only nerve\r\nCan carry anguish from this to thy soul,\r\nIs that credulity which ties the mind\r\nFirmly to notional creature as to real.\r\nAdvise thee, then; dark in thyself keep hid\r\nThis grief; and thou wilt shortly find it dying.\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nJudith,\r\nPardon our ecstasy. 'Tis time thou hadst\r\nOur honour. But first tell us all the event,\r\nThat in thy proper height thou with thy deed\r\nMay stand against our worship.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nWhy do you stop\r\nYour shouts, and glare upon me? Have you need\r\nTruly to hear my tale? I think, not so.\r\nOzias here, as he hath whiled at ease\r\nUpon the walls my stay in the camp yonder,\r\nHath fairly fancied all that I have done,\r\nAnd more exactly, and with a relishing gust,\r\nAll that was done to me. Ask him, therefore;\r\nIf he hath not already entertained\r\nYour tedious leisure with my story told\r\nPat to your liking, enjoyed, and glosst with praise. - \r\nAnd yet, why ask him? Why go even so far\r\nTo hear it? Ask but the clever libidinousness\r\nDwelling in each of your hearts, and it will surely\r\nImagine for you how I trained to my arms\r\nLewd Holofernes, and kept him plied with lust,\r\nUntil his wild blood in the end paused fainting,\r\nAnd he lay twitching, drained of all his wits; - \r\nBut there was wine as well working in him,\r\nFeebling his sinews; 'twas not all my doing,\r\nThe snoring fit that came before his death,\r\nThe routing beastly slumber that was my time.\r\nYou know it all! Why ask me for the tale?\n\r\nOzias.\r\nComfort her: praise her. She is strangely ashamed\r\nOf Holofernes having evilly used her.\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nWe will contrive the triumph of our joy\r\nInto some tune of words, and bring thee on,\r\nAccompanied by singing, to thy house.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nI pray you, rather let me go alone.\r\nYou will do better to be searching out\r\nAll sharpen'd steel that may take weapon-use.\r\nThe Assyrians are afraid: it is your time.\n\r\n[They surround JUDITH and go with her.]\n\r\nCHORUS of Citizens praising JUDITH and\r\nleading her to her house.\r\nOver us and past us go the years;\r\nLike wind that taketh sound from jubilee\r\nAnd aloud flieth ringing,\r\nOver us goeth the speed of the years,\r\nLike loud noise eternally bringing\r\nThe greatness women have done.\n\r\nDeborah was great; with her singing\r\nShe hearten'd the men that the horses had dismayed;\r\nDeborah, the wife of Lapidoth, alone\r\nStood singing where the men were horribly afraid,\r\nSinging of God in the midst of fear;\r\nWhen archers out of Hazor were\r\nEating the land like grasshoppers,\r\nAnd darkness at noon was plundering the air\r\nOf the light of the sun's insulted fires,\r\nRed darkness covering Sisera's host\r\nAs Jewry was covered by the Canaanite's boast:\r\nFor the earth was broken into dust beneath\r\nThe force of his chariots' thundering tyres,\r\nNine hundred chariots of iron.\n\r\nDeborah was great in her prophesying;\r\nBut, though her anger moved through the Israelites,\r\nAnd the loose tribes her indignant crying\r\nBound into song, fashion'd to an army;\r\nAnd before the measure of her song went flying,\r\nLike leaves and breakage of the woods\r\nFallen into pouring floods,\r\nThe iron and the men of Sisera and Jabin;\r\nNot by her alone\r\nGod's punishment was done\r\nOn Canaan intending a monstrous crime,\r\nOn the foaming and poison of the serpent in Hazor;\r\nTwo women were the power of God that time.\n\r\nYea, and sullenly down\r\nInto its hiding town,\r\nEven though the lightning were still in its heart,\r\nThe broken dragon, drawing in its fury,\r\nHad croucht to mend its shatter'd malice,\r\nHad lifted its head again and spat against God.\r\nBut God its endlessly devising brain,\r\nIts braving spirit, its captain Sisera,\r\nInto the hands of another woman brought:\r\nIn nets of her persuasion\r\nShe that wild spirit caught,\r\nShe fasten'd up that uncontrollable thought.\r\nSisera spake, and the crops were flames;\r\nSisera lookt, and blood ran down the door-sills.\r\nBut weary, trusting his entertainment,\r\nHe came to Jael, the Kenite woman;\r\nA woman who gave him death for a bed,\r\nAnd with base tools nailed down his murderous head\r\nFast to the earth his rage had fed\r\nWith men unreckonably slain.\n\r\nBut than these wonderfully greater,\r\nJudith, art thou;\r\nThe praise of both shall follow like a shadow\r\nAfter thy glory now,\r\nWho alone the measureless striding,\r\nThe high ungovern'd brow,\r\nOf Assur upon the hills of the world\r\nHast tript and sent him hugely sliding,\r\nLike a shot beast, down from his towering,\r\nBy his own lamed\r\nMightiness hurl'd\r\nTo lie a filth in disaster.\r\nDeborah and Jael, famously named,\r\nLike rich lands enriching the city their master,\r\nBring thee now their most golden honour.\r\nFor the beauty of thy limbs was found\r\nBy a dreadfuller enemy dreadful as the sound\r\nOf Deborah's singing, though hers was a song\r\nThat had for its words thousands of men.\r\nBut thou thyself, looking upon them,\r\nDidst weaken the Assyrians mortally.\r\nThey thought it terrible to see thee coming;\r\nThey falter'd in their impiousness,\r\nTheir hearts gave in to thee; they went\r\nBackward before thee and shewed thee the tent\r\nWhere Holofernes would have thee in to him,\r\nYea, for his slayer waiting,\r\nWaiting thee to entertain,\r\nDesiring thee, his death, to enjoy, as Jael\r\nWaited for Sisera her slain.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nHave done! Do you think I know not why your souls\r\nAre so delighted round me? Do you think\r\nI see not what it is you praise? - not me,\r\nBut you yourselves triumphing in me and over me.\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nDid we kill Holofernes?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nNo: nor I.\r\nThat corpse was not his death. He is alive,\r\nAnd will be till there is no more a world\r\nFilled with his hidden hunger, waiting for souls\r\nThat ford the monstrous waters of the world.\r\nAlive in you is Holofernes now,\r\nBut fed and rejoicing; I have filled your hunger.\r\nYea, and alive in me: my spirit hath been\r\nEnjoyed by the lust of the world, and I am changed\r\nVilely by the vile thing that clutcht on me,\r\nLike sulphurous smoke eating into silver.\r\nYour song is all of this, this your rejoicing;\r\nYou have good right to circle me with song!\r\nYou are the world, and you have fed on me.\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nWe are the world; yes, but the world for ever\r\nHonouring thee.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nHow am I honoured so,\r\nIf I no honour have for the world, but rather\r\nHold it an odious and traitorous thing,\r\nThat means no honour but to those whose spirits\r\nHave yielded to its ancient lechery? - \r\nDefiled, defiled!\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nThou wert moved by our grief:\r\nWas that a vile thing?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nThat was the cunning world.\r\nIt moved me by your grief to give myself\r\nInto the pleasure of its ravenous love.\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nJudith, if thy hot spirit beareth still\r\nIndignant suffering of villainy,\r\nThink, that thou hast no wrong from it. Such things\r\nAre in themselves dead, and have only life\r\nFrom what lives round them. And around thee glory\r\nLives and will force its splendour on the harm\r\nThy purity endured, making it shine\r\nLike diamond in sunlight, as before\r\nUnviolated it could not.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nAy, to you\r\nI doubt not I seem admirable now,\r\nWorthy of being sung in loudest praise;\r\nBut to myself how seem I?\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nSurely as one\r\nWhose charity went down the stairs of hell,\r\nAnd barter'd with the fiends thy sacredest\r\nFor our deliverance.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nAnd that you praise! - \r\nI was a virgin spirit. Whence I come\r\nI know not, and I care not whither I go.\r\nOne fearful knowledge holds me: that I am\r\nA spirit walking dangerously here.\r\nFor the world covets me. I am alone,\r\nAnd made of something which the world has not,\r\nUnless its substance can devour my spirit.\r\nAnd it hath devoured me! In Holofernes\r\nIt seized me, fed on me; and then gibed on me,\r\nWith show of his death scoffing at my rage, - \r\nHis death! - He lay there, drunken, glutted with me,\r\nAnd his bare falchion hung beside the bed, - \r\nLook on it, and look on the blood I made\r\nGo pouring thunder of pleasure through his brain! - \r\nAnd like a mad thing hitting at the madness\r\nThronging upon it in a grinning rout,\r\nI my defilement smote, that Holofernes.\r\nBut does a maniac kill the frenzy in him,\r\nWhen with his fists he beats the clambering fiends\r\nThat swarm against his limbs? No more did I\r\nKill my defilement; it was fast within me;\r\nAnd like a frenzy can go out of me\r\nAnd dress its hideous motions in my world.\r\nFor when I come back here, behold the thing\r\nI murdered in the camp leaps up and yells!\r\nThe carrion Holofernes, my defilement,\r\nDances a triumph round me, roars and rejoices,\r\nQuickened to hundreds of exulting lives.\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nGod help thee in this wildness! Are we then\r\nAs Holofernes to thee?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nYou are naught\r\nBut the defilement that is in me now,\r\nRejoicing to be lodged safely within me.\r\nYou are the lust I entertained, rejoicing\r\nTo wreak itself upon my purity.\r\nThe stratagems of my ravishment you are,\r\nRejoicing that the will you serve has dealt\r\nIts power on me. O, I hate you not.\r\nYou and your crying grief should have blown past\r\nMy heart like wind shaking a fasten'd casement.\r\nBut I must have you in. Myself I loathe\r\nFor opening to you, and thereby opening\r\nTo the demon which had set you on to whine\r\nPitiably in the porches of my spirit.\r\nYou are but noise; but he is the lust of the world,\r\nThe infinite wrong the spirit, the virgin spirit,\r\nMust fasten against, or be for ever vile.\n\r\nA Citizen.\r\nBut is it naught that we, the folk of God,\r\nAre safe by thee?\n\r\nJudith.\r\nGod hath his own devices.\r\nBut I would be God's helper! I would be\r\nKnown as the woman whom his strength had chosen\r\nTo ruin the Assyrians! - O my God,\r\nHow dreadfully thou punishest small sins!\r\nIf it is thou who punishest; but rather\r\nIt is that, when we slacken in perceiving\r\nThe world's intent towards us, and fatally,\r\nEnticed out of suspicion by fair signs,\r\nGo from ignoring its proposals, down\r\nTo parley, - thou our weakness dost permit.\r\nIn all my days I from the greed of the world\r\nVirginal have kept my spirit's dwelling, - \r\nTill now; yea, all my being I have maintained\r\nSacredly my own possession; for love\r\nBut made more beautiful and more divine\r\nMy spirit's ownership. And yet no warning,\r\nWhen I infatuate went down to be\r\nProcuress of myself to the world's desire,\r\nDid God blaze on my blindness, no rebuke.\r\nTherefore I am no more my virgin own,\r\nBut hatefully, unspeakably, the world's.\r\nTo these now I belong; they took me and used me.\r\nI have no pride to live for; and why else\r\nShould one stay living, if not joyfully proud?\r\nFor I have yielded now; mercilessly\r\nWhat is makes foolish nothing of what was.\r\nTo know the world, for all its grasping hands,\r\nFor all its heat to utter its pent nature\r\nInto the souls that must go faring through it,\r\nAvailing nothing against purity,\r\nMade always like rebellion trodden under, - \r\nBy this was life a noble labour. Now\r\nI have been persuaded into the world's pleasure:\r\nAnd now at last I will all certainly\r\nContrive for myself the death of Holofernes.\n\r\n [OZIAS comes behind her and catches the lifted falchion.]\n\r\nJudith.\r\nIt was well done, Ozias.\n\r\nOzias.\r\nI have watcht\r\nThy anguish growing, and I lookt for this.\n\r\nJudith.\r\nThou knowest me better than I know myself.\r\nWhat moves in me is strange and uncontrolled,\r\nThat once I thought was ruled: thou knew'st me better. - \r\nIndeed thou must forgive me; what was I\r\nTo take so bitterly thy suit? What right\r\nHad I to give thee anger, when thou wouldst\r\nBrighten thy hopeless death with me enjoyed,\r\nI, even from that anger, going to be\r\nHolofernes' pleasure? - Thou knewest me better,\r\nAnd therefore shalt forgive me. Ay, no doubt\r\nMy spirit answered thee so fiercely then\r\nBecause it felt thee reading me aright,\r\nHow a mere bragging was my purity.\r\nBut now to pardon askt, I must add thanks. - \r\nI had forgot Manasses! Even love\r\nWas driven forth of me by these loud mouths!\r\nWhether in death he waits for me, I know not;\r\nBut it had been an unforgivable thing\r\nTo have made this the end; not to have gone\r\nTo death as unto spousals, leaving life\r\nAs one sets down a work faithfully done,\r\nAnd knows oneself by service justified,\r\nWorthy of love, whether love be or not.\r\nBut, soiled with detestation, to have thrown\r\nFiercely aside the garment of this light;\r\nProved at the last impatient, death desiring\r\nLike a mere doffing of foul drench'd clothes;\r\nRelease from the wicked hindering mire of sorrow;\r\nA comfortable darkness hiding me\r\nOut of the glowing world myself have made\r\nAn insult, domineering me with splendour; - \r\nO such a death had turned, past all forgiving,\r\nMy insult to Manasses, and searcht him out,\r\nEven where he is quiet, with the blaze,\r\nRanging like din, of this contempt, this triumph.\r\nNot crying out such hateful news should I\r\nFlee hunted into death, unto my love.\r\nFrom this, Ozias, thou hast saved me. Now\r\nI am to learn my shame, that not amazed,\r\nBut practised in my burden, I at last,\r\nWhen my time comes, may all in gladness fare\r\nThe road made sacred by Manasses' feet.\n\r\n[JUDITH goes into her house.]\n\r\nOzias (addressing the citizens).\r\nYou do well to be stricken silent here.\r\nTerrible Holofernes slain by a woman\r\nWas something wonderful, to be noised aloud;\r\nBut this is a wonder past applauding thought,\r\nThis grief darkening Judith, in the midst\r\nOf the new shining glory she herself\r\nHas brought to conquer in our skies the storm.\r\nYou do well to be dumb: for you have seen\r\nVirginity. That spirit you have seen,\r\nSeen made wrathfully plain that secret spirit,\r\nWhereby is man's frail scabbard filled with steel.\r\nThis, cumbered in the earthen kind of man,\r\nWhich ceaseless waters would be wearing down,\r\nAlone giveth him stubborn substance, holds him\r\nUpright and hard against impious fate.\r\nAll things within it would the world possess,\r\nAnd have them in the tide of its desire:\r\nMan hath his nature of the vehement world;\r\nHe is a torrent like the stars and beasts\r\nFlowing to answer the fierce world's desire.\r\nBut like a giant wading in the sea\r\nStands in the rapture, and refusing it,\r\nAnd looking upward out of it to find\r\nWho knows what sign? - spirit, virginity;\r\nA power caught by the power of the world;\r\nThe spirit in whose unknown hope doth man\r\nDeny the mastery of his fortune here;\r\nVirginity, whose pride, impassion'd only\r\nTo be as she herself would be, nor thence\r\nTo loosen for the world's endeavouring,\r\nAnd, though all give the rash obedience, stand\r\nHer own possession, - this virginity,\r\nThis pride of the spirit, asking no reward\r\nBut to be pride unthrown, this is the force\r\nWhereby man hath his courage in the strange\r\nFearful turmoil of being conscious man.\r\nYea, worshipping this spirit, he will at last\r\nGrow into high divine imagination,\r\nWherein the envious wildness of the world\r\nYieldeth its striving up to him, and takes\r\nHis mind, building the endless stars like stone\r\nTo house his towering joy of self-possessing.\r\nThis made you dumb; ignorant knowledge of this,\r\nBlind vision of virginity's mightiness,\r\nDid chide the exclamation in your hearts.\r\nAnd think not you have seen, in Judith's grief,\r\nVirginity drown'd in the pouring world.\r\nFor what is done is naught; what is, is all:\r\nAnd Judith is virginity's appointed.\r\nEven by her injury she showeth us,\r\nAs fire by violence may be revealed,\r\nHow sovereign is virginity. - \r\nBut let us now consult what way her grief,\r\nWhich is not to be understood by us,\r\nMay spend itself, with naught to urge its power.\r\nLet us within our walls keep close this tale,\r\nClose as the famine and the thirst were kept\r\nDevouring us by the Assyrians.\r\nLet there be no news going through the land\r\nOut of Bethulia but this: that we\r\nAt Judith's hands had our deliverance,\r\nBut she from Holofernes and his crew\r\nUnwilling and astonisht reverence,\r\nAs they were men with minds opprest by God.\n\n\n\n\r\nTHE ETERNAL WEDDING\n\n\r\nHe.\r\nEven as a wind that hasteth round the world\r\nFrom out cold hours fill'd with shadow of earth,\r\nTo pour alight against the risen sun;\r\nSo unto thee adoring, out of its shadow\r\nFloweth my spirit, into the light of thee\r\nWhich Beauty is, and Joy. From my own fate,\r\nFrom out the darkness wherein long I fared\r\nWorshipping stars and morsels of the light,\r\nThrough doors of golden morning now I pass\r\nInto the great whole light and perfect day\r\nOf shining Beauty, open to me at last.\r\nYea, into thee now do I pass, beloved:\r\nBeauty and thou are mine!\n\r\nShe.\r\nAnd I am thine!\r\nI am desirable to my desire:\r\nThence am I clean as immortality\r\nWith Beauty and Joy, the fiery power of Beauty.\n\r\nHe.\r\nAnd by my spirit made marvellous here by thee,\r\nPoured out all clear into the gold of thee,\r\nNot myself only do I know; I have\r\nGolden within me the whole fate of man:\r\nThat every flesh and soul belongs to one\r\nContinual joyward ravishment, whose end\r\nIs here, in this perfection. Now I know - \r\nFor all my speculation soareth up,\r\nA bird taking eternity for air, - \r\nNow being mixt with thee, in the burning midst\r\nOf Beauty for my sense and mind and soul, - \r\nThat life hath highest gone which hath most joy.\r\nFor like great wings forcefully smiting air\r\nAnd driving it along in rushing rivers,\r\nDesire of joy beats mightily pulsing forward\r\nThe world's one nature, and all the loose lives therein,\r\nCarried and greatly streaming on a gale\r\nOf craving, swept fiercely along in beauty; - \r\nLike a great weather of wind and shining sun,\r\nWhen the airs pick up whole huge waves of sea,\r\nCrumble them in their grasp and high aloft\r\nSow them glittering, a white watery dust,\r\nTo company with light: so we are driven\r\nOnward and upward in a wind of beauty,\r\nUntil man's race be wielded by its joy\r\nInto some high incomparable day,\r\nWhere perfectly delight may know itself, - \r\nNo longer need a strife to know itself,\r\nOnly by its prevailing over pain.\n\r\nShe.\r\nBeloved, but no pain may strive with us.\n\r\nHe.\r\nNo, for we are flown far ahead of life:\r\nThe feet of our Spirit have wonderfully trod\r\nThe dangers of the rushing fate of life,\r\nAs summer-searching birds tread with their wings\r\nMountainous surges in the air. But many,\r\nNot strongly fledge to ride the world's great rapture,\r\nMust break, down fallen into steep confusion,\r\nWhere we climb easily and tower with joy.\r\nNevertheless doth life foretell in us\r\nHow it shall all make seizure at the last\r\nUpon this height of ecstasy, this fort\r\nLife like an army storms: Captains we are\r\nIn the great assault; and where we stand alone\r\nWithin these hours, built like establisht flames\r\nRound us, at long last all man's life shall stand\r\nAt peace with joy, wearing delighted sense\r\nAs meadows wear their golden pleasure of flowers.\r\nCertain my heart dwells in these builded hours,\r\nThat there is no more beauty beyond thee.\r\nThou art my utter beauty; and - behold\r\nThe marvel, God in Heaven! - I am thine.\r\nTherefore we know, in this height-guarded place\r\nWhereto the speed of our desire hath brought us;\r\nHere in this safety crowning, like a fort\r\nBuilt upon topmost peaks, the height of beauty, - \r\nWe know to be glad of life as we were gods\r\nTimelessly glad of deity; yea, to enjoy\r\nFleshly, spiritual Being till the swift\r\nTorrent of glee (as hurled star-dust can change\r\nDim earthly weather to a moment like the sun,)\r\nDoth startle life to self-adoring godhead, - \r\nDivine body of Power and divine\r\nBurning soul of Light and self-desire.\r\nAnd having given ourselves all to amazement,\r\nWe are made like a prophesying song\r\nOf life all joy, a bride in the arms of God. - \r\nYea, God shall marry his people at the last;\r\nAnd every man and woman who has sworn\r\nThat only joy can make this Being sacred,\r\nWeaves at the wedding-garment.\n\r\nShe.\r\nAh, my beloved,\r\nFeelest thou too that out of earth and time\r\nWe are transgressing into Heavenly hours?\r\nOr, threading the dark worldly multitude\r\nAnd making lightning of its path, there comes\r\nA zeal from God posting along our lives.\n\r\nHe.\r\nFor some eternal pulse hath chosen us,\r\nSome divine anger beats within our hearts.\n\r\nShe.\r\nAnger? But how far off is love from anger!\n\r\nHe.\r\nNay, both belong to joy; joy's kind is twain.\r\nAnd close as in the pouring of sun-flame\r\nAre mingled glory of light and fury of heat,\r\nJoy utters its twin radiance, love and anger;\r\nIf joy be not indeed all sacred wrath\r\nWith circumstance; indignant memory\r\nOf what hath been, when the new lusts of God\r\nExulted unimaginably, before\r\nRigours of law fastened like creeping habit\r\nUpon their measureless wont, and forced them drive\r\nTheir ranging music of delighted being\r\nThrough the fixt beating tune of a circling world. - \r\nIs not love so? Amazement of an anger\r\nAgainst created shape and narrowness?\r\nThe bound rage of the uncreated Spirit\r\nWhose striving doth impassion us and the world?\r\nA wrath that thou and I are not one being?\n\r\nShe.\r\nYes, and not only words that thou and I\r\nOut of our sexes with a flame's escape\r\nAre fashioned into one. The Spirit in us\r\nHath, like imagination in a prison,\r\nKindled itself free of all boundary,\r\nSo that it hath no room but its own joy,\r\nAmple as at the first, before it fell\r\nInto this burthenous habit of a world.\r\nWhat have we now to do with the world? We are\r\nMade one unworldly thing; we are past the world;\r\nYea, and unmade: we are immortality.\n\r\nHe.\r\nAnd only fools abominably crazed,\r\nThose who will set imagination down\r\nAs less in truth than their dim sensual wit,\r\nDare doubt that, while these dreams of ours, these bodies,\r\nStill quiver in the world each with its own\r\nDelight, the great divine wrath of our love\r\nHath stricken off from us the place of the world!\r\nYea, as we walk in spiritual freedom\r\nUpright before the shining face of God,\r\nBehold, as it were the shadow of our stature\r\nThrown by that light, we draw the world behind us, - \r\nThat world wherein, darkly I remember,\r\nWe thought we were as twain.\n\r\nShe.\r\nYet, since God means\r\nThat love should sunder our fixt separateness\r\nAnd make our married spirits leap together,\r\nAs lightning out of the clouds of sexual flesh,\r\nInto one sexless undivided joy;\r\nWhy hath he made us a divided flesh?\r\nWe being single ecstasy, now as strange\r\nAs if a shadow stained where no one stood\r\nThe ground in the noon-glare, seemeth to me\r\nThe long blind time wherein our lives and the world\r\nLay stretcht out dark upon the light of heaven,\r\nLike shadow of some bulk that took the glory;\r\nWhile yet there stood not over it, to shade\r\nThe splendour from it, our heaven-fronting love,\r\nThis great new soul that our two souls have kindled.\r\nYea, and how like, that in the world's chance-medley\r\nThis our exulting destiny had been slain,\r\nThough here it lords the world as a man his shadow!\n\r\nHe.\r\nBut the world is not chance, except to those\r\nMost feeble in desire: who needeth aught\r\nShall have it, if he fill his soul with the need.\r\nWhile still our ignorant lives were drowned beneath\r\nThe flooding of the earthly fate, and chance\r\nSeemed pouring mightily dark and loud between us,\r\nUnspeakable news oft visited our hearts:\r\nWe knew each other by desire; yea, spake\r\nOut of the strength of darkness flowing o'er us,\r\nAcross the hindering outcry of the world\r\nOne to another sweet desirable things.\r\nUntil at last we took such heavenly lust\r\nOf those unheard messages into our lives,\r\nWe were made abler than the worldly fate.\r\nWe held its random enmity as frost\r\nThe storming Northern seas, and fastened it\r\nIn likeness of our love's imagining;\r\nOr as a captain with his courage holds\r\nThe mutinous blood of an army aghast with fear,\r\nAnd maketh it unwillingly dare his purpose,\r\nOur lust of love struck its commandment deep\r\nInto the froward turbulence of world\r\nThat parted us. Suddenly the dark noise\r\nCleft and went backward from us, and we stood\r\nKnowing each other in a quiet light;\r\nAnd like wise music made of many strings\r\nFollowing and adoring underneath\r\nPrevailing song, fate lived beneath our love,\r\nUnder the masterful excellent silence of it,\r\nA multitudinous obedience.\n\r\nShe.\r\nYea, but not this my marvel: not that we\r\nShould master with desire the sundering world,\r\nWe who bore in our hearts such destiny,\r\nThere was no force knew to be dangerous\r\nAgainst it, but must turn its malice clean\r\nInto obsequious favour worshipping us.\r\nRather hath this astonisht me, that we\r\nHave not for ever lived in this high hour.\r\nOnly to be twin elements of joy\r\nIn this extravagance of Being, Love,\r\nWere our divided natures shaped in twain;\r\nAnd to this hour the whole world must consent.\r\nIs it not very marvellous, our lives\r\nCan only come to this out of a long\r\nStrange sundering, with the years of the world between us?\n\r\nHe.\r\nShall life do more than God? for hath not God\r\nStriven with himself, when into known delight\r\nHis unaccomplisht joy he would put forth, - \r\nThis mystery of a world sign of his striving?\r\nElse wherefore this, a thing to break the mind\r\nWith labouring in the wonder of it, that here\r\nBeing - the world and we - is suffered to be! - \r\nBut, lying on thy breast one notable day,\r\nSudden exceeding agony of love\r\nMade my mind a trance of infinite knowledge.\r\nI was not: yet I saw the will of God\r\nAs light unfashion'd, unendurable flame,\r\nInterminable, not to be supposed;\r\nAnd there was no more creature except light, - \r\nThe dreadful burning of the lonely God's\r\nUnutter'd joy. And then, past telling, came\r\nShuddering and division in the light:\r\nTherein, like trembling, was desire to know\r\nIts own perfect beauty; and it became\r\nA cloven fire, a double flaming, each\r\nAdorable to each; against itself\r\nWaging a burning love, which was the world; - \r\nA moment satisfied in that love-strife\r\nI knew the world! - And when I fell from there,\r\nThen knew I also what this life would do\r\nIn being twain, - in being man and woman!\r\nFor it would do even as its endless Master,\r\nMaking the world, had done; yea, with itself\r\nWould strive, and for the strife would into sex\r\nBe cloven, double burning, made thereby\r\nDesirable to itself. Contriv'd joy\r\nIs sex in life; and by no other thing\r\nThan by a perfect sundering, could life\r\nChange the dark stream of unappointed joy\r\nTo perfect praise of itself, the glee that loves\r\nAnd worships its own Being. This is ours!\r\nYet only for that we have been so long\r\nSundered desire: thence is our life all praise. - \r\nBut we, well knowing by our strength of joy\r\nThere is no sundering more, how far we love\r\nFrom those sad lives that know a half-love only,\r\nAlone thereby knowing themselves for ever\r\nSealed in division of love, and therefore made\r\nTo pour their strength out always into their love's\r\nFierceness, as green wood bleeds its hissing sap\r\nInto red heat of a fire! Not so do we:\r\nThe cloven anger, life, hath left to wage\r\nIts flame against itself, here turned to one\r\nSelf-adoration. - Ah, what comes of this?\r\nThe joy falters a moment, with closed wings\r\nWearying in its upward journey, ere\r\nAgain it goes on high, bearing its song,\r\nIts delight breathing and its vigour beating\r\nThe highest height of the air above the world.\n\r\nShe.\r\nWhat hast thou done to me! - I would have soul,\r\nBefore I knew thee, Love, a captive held\r\nBy flesh. Now, inly delighted with desire,\r\nMy body knows itself to be nought else\r\nBut thy heart's worship of me; and my soul\r\nTherein is sunlight held by warm gold air.\r\nNay, all my body is become a song\r\nUpon the breath of spirit, a love-song.\n\r\nHe.\r\nAnd mine is all like one rapt faculty,\r\nAs it were listening to the love in thee,\r\nMy whole mortality trembling to take\r\nThy body like heard singing of thy spirit.\n\r\nShe.\r\nSurely by this, Beloved, we must know\r\nOur love is perfect here, - that not as holds\r\nThe common dullard thought, we are things lost\r\nIn an amazement that is all unware;\r\nBut wonderfully knowing what we are!\r\nLo, now that body is the song whereof\r\nSpirit is mood, knoweth not our delight?\r\nKnoweth not beautifully now our love,\r\nThat Life, here to this festival bid come\r\nClad in his splendour of worldly day and night,\r\nFilled and empower'd by heavenly lust, is all\r\nThe glad imagination of the Spirit?\n\r\nHe.\r\nWere it not so, Love could not be at all:\r\nNought could be, but a yearning to fulfil\r\nDesire of beauty, by vain reaching forth\r\nOf sense to hold and understand the vision\r\nMade by impassion'd body, - vision of thee!\r\nBut music mixt with music are, in love,\r\nBodily senses; and as flame hath light,\r\nSpirit this nature hath imagined round it,\r\nNo way concealed therein, when love comes near,\r\nNor in the perfect wedding of desires\r\nSuffering any hindrance.\n\r\nShe.\r\nAh, but now,\r\nNow am I given love's eternal secret!\r\nYea, thou and I who speak, are but the joy\r\nOf our for ever mated spirits; but now\r\nThe wisdom of my gladness even through Spirit\r\nLooks, divinely elate. Who hath for joy\r\nOur Spirits? Who hath imagined them\r\nRound him in fashion'd radiance of desire,\r\nAs into light of these exulting bodies\r\nFlaming Spirit is uttered?\n\r\nHe.\r\nYea, here the end\r\nOf love's astonishment! Now know we Spirit,\r\nAnd Who, for ease of joy, contriveth Spirit.\r\nNow all life's loveliness and power we have\r\nDissolved in this one moment, and our burning\r\nCarries all shining upward, till in us\r\nLife is not life, but the desire of God,\r\nHimself desiring and himself accepting.\r\nNow what was prophecy in us is made\r\nFulfilment: we are the hour and we are the joy,\r\nWe in our marvellousness of single knowledge,\r\nOf Spirit breaking down the room of fate\r\nAnd drawing into his light the greeting fire\r\nOf God, - God known in ecstasy of love\r\nWedding himself to utterance of himself.\n\n\n\n\r\nMARRIAGE SONG\n\n\r\nI\n\r\nCome up, dear chosen morning, come,\r\nBlessing the air with light,\r\nAnd bid the sky repent of being dark:\r\nLet all the spaces round the world be white,\r\nAnd give the earth her green again.\r\nInto new hours of beautiful delight,\r\nOut of the shadow where she has lain,\r\nBring the earth awake for glee,\r\nShining with dews as fresh and clear\r\nAs my beloved's voice upon the air.\r\nFor now, O morning chosen of all days, on thee\r\nA wondrous duty lies:\r\nThere was an evening that did loveliness foretell;\r\nThence upon thee, O chosen morn, it fell\r\nTo fashion into perfect destiny\r\nThe radiant prophecy.\r\nFor in an evening of young moon, that went\r\nFilling the moist air with a rosy fire,\r\nI and my beloved knew our love;\r\nAnd knew that thou, O morning, wouldst arise\r\nTo give us knowledge of achieved desire.\r\nFor, standing stricken with astonishment,\r\nHalf terrified in the delight,\r\nEven as the moon did into clear air move\r\nAnd made a golden light,\r\nLo there, croucht up against it, a dark hill,\r\nA monstrous back of earth, a spine\r\nOf hunch'd rock, furred with great growth of pine,\r\nLay like a beast, snout in its paws, asleep;\r\nYet in its sleeping seemed it miserable,\r\nAs though strong fear must always keep\r\nHold of its heart, and drive its blood in dream.\r\nYea, for to our new love, did it not seem,\r\nThat dark and quiet length of hill,\r\nThe sleeping grief of the world? - Out of it we\r\nHad like imaginations stept to be\r\nBeauty and golden wonder; and for the lovely fear\r\nOf coming perfect joy, had changed\r\nThe terror that dreamt there!\r\nAnd now the golden moon had turned\r\nTo shining white, white as our souls that burned\r\nWith vision of our prophecy assured:\r\nSuddenly white was the moon; but she\r\nAt once did on a woven modesty\r\nOf cloud, and soon went in obscured:\r\nAnd we were dark, and vanisht that strange hill.\r\nBut yet it was not long before\r\nThere opened in the sky a narrow door,\r\nMade with pearl lintel and pearl sill;\r\nAnd the earth's night seem'd pressing there, - \r\nAll as a beggar on some festival would peer, - \r\nTo gaze into a room of light beyond,\r\nThe hidden silver splendour of the moon.\r\nYea, and we also, we\r\nLong gazed wistfully\r\nTowards thee, O morning, come at last,\r\nAnd towards the light that thou wilt pour upon us soon!\n\n\r\nII\n\r\nO soul who still art strange to sense,\r\nWho often against beauty wouldst complain,\r\nDoubting between joy and pain:\r\nIf like the startling touch of something keen\r\nAgainst thee, it hath been\r\nTo follow from an upland height\r\nThe swift sun hunting rain\r\nAcross the April meadows of a plain,\r\nUntil the fields would flash into the air\r\nTheir joyous green, like emeralds alight;\r\nOr when in the blue of night's mid-noon\r\nThe burning naked moon\r\nDraws to a brink of cloudy weather near,\r\nA breadth of snow, firm and soft as a wing,\r\nStretcht out over a wind that gently goes, - \r\nThrough the white sleep of snowy cloud there grows\r\nAn azure-border'd shining ring,\r\nThe gleaming dream of the approaching joy of her; - \r\nWhat now wilt thou do, Soul? What now,\r\nIf with such things as these troubled thou wert?\r\nHow wilt thou now endure, or how\r\nNot now be strangely hurt? - \r\nWhen utter beauty must come closer to thee\r\nThan even anger or fear could be;\r\nWhen thou, like metal in a kiln, must lie\r\nSeized by beauty's mightily able flame;\r\nEnjoyed by beauty as by the ruthless glee\r\nOf an unescapable power;\r\nObeying beauty as air obeys a cry;\r\nYea, one thing made of beauty and thee,\r\nAs steel and a white heat are made the same!\r\n - Ah, but I know how this infirmity\r\nWill fail and be not, no, not memory,\r\nWhen I begin the marvellous hour.\r\nThis only is my heart's strain'd eagerness,\r\nLong waiting for its bliss. - \r\nBut from those other fears, from those\r\nThat keep to Love so close,\r\nFrom fears that are the shadow of delight,\r\nHide me, O joys; make them unknown to-night!\n\n\r\nIII\n\r\nThou bright God that in dream earnest to me last night,\r\nThou with the flesh made of a golden light,\r\nKnew I not thee, thee and thy heart,\r\nKnew I not well, God, who thou wert?\r\nYea, and my soul divinely understood\r\nThe light that was beneath thee a ground,\r\nThe golden light that cover'd thee round,\r\nTurning my sleep to a fiery morn,\r\nWas as a heavenly oath there sworn\r\nPromising me an immortal good:\r\nWell I knew thee, God of Marriages, thee and thy flame!\r\nAh, but wherefore beside thee came\r\nThat fearful sight of another mood?\r\nWhy in thy light, to thy hand chained,\r\nTowards me its bondage terribly strained,\r\nWhy came with thee that dreadful hound,\r\nThe wild hound Fear, black, ravenous and gaunt?\r\nWhy him with thee should thy dear light surround?\r\nWhy broughtest thou that beast to haunt\r\nThe blissful footsteps of my golden dream? - \r\nAll shadowy black the body dread,\r\nAll frenzied fire the head, - \r\nThe hunger of its mouth a hollow crimson flame,\r\nThe hatred in its eyes a blaze\r\nFierce and green, stabbing the ruddy glaze,\r\nAnd sharp white jetting fire the teeth snarl'd at me,\r\nAnd white the dribbling rage of froth, - \r\nA throat that gaped to bay and paws working violently,\r\nYet soundless all as a winging moth;\r\nTugging towards me, famishing for my heart; - \r\nEven while thou, O golden god, wert still\r\nLooking the beautiful kindness of thy will\r\nInto my soul, even then must I be,\r\nWith thy bright promise looking at me,\r\nThen bitterly of that hound afraid? - \r\nDarkness, I know, attendeth bright,\r\nAnd light comes not but shadow comes:\r\nAnd heart must know, if it know thy light,\r\nThy wild hound Fear, the shadow of love's delight.\r\nYea, is it thus? Are we so made\r\nOf death and darkness, that even thou,\r\nO golden God of the joys of love,\r\nThy mind to us canst only prove,\r\nThe glorious devices of thy mind,\r\nBy so revealing how thy journeying here\r\nThrough this mortality, doth closely bind\r\nThy brightness to the shadow of dreadful Fear? - \r\nAh no, it shall not be! Thy joyous light\r\nShall hide me from the hunger of fear to-night.\n\n\r\nIV\n\r\nFor wonderfully to live I now begin:\r\nSo that the darkness which accompanies\r\nOur being here, is fasten'd up within\r\nThe power of light that holdeth me;\r\nAnd from these shining chains, to see\r\nMy joy with bold misliking eyes,\r\nThe shrouded figure will not dare arise.\r\nFor henceforth, from to-night,\r\nI am wholly gone into the bright\r\nSafety of the beauty of love:\r\nNot only all my waking vigours plied\r\nUnder the searching glory of love,\r\nBut knowing myself with love all satisfied\r\nEven when my life is hidden in sleep;\r\nAs high clouds, to themselves that keep\r\nThe moon's white company, are all possest\r\nSilverly with the presence of their guest;\r\nOr as a darken'd room\r\nThat hath within it roses, whence the air\r\nAnd quietness are taken everywhere\r\nDeliciously by sweet perfume.\n\n\n\n\r\nEPILOGUE\n\n\n\n\r\nEPILOGUE\n\n\r\nWhat shall we do for Love these days?\r\nHow shall we make an altar-blaze\r\nTo smite the horny eyes of men\r\nWith the renown of our Heaven,\r\nAnd to the unbelievers prove\r\nOur service to our dear god, Love?\r\nWhat torches shall we lift above\r\nThe crowd that pushes through the mire,\r\nTo amaze the dark heads with strange fire?\r\nI should think I were much to blame,\r\nIf never I held some fragrant flame\r\nAbove the noises of the world,\r\nAnd openly 'mid men's hurrying stares,\r\nWorshipt before the sacred fears\r\nThat are like flashing curtains furl'd\r\nAcross the presence of our lord Love.\r\nNay, would that I could fill the gaze\r\nOf the whole earth with some great praise\r\nMade in a marvel for men's eyes,\r\nSome tower of glittering masonries,\r\nTherein such a spirit flourishing\r\nMen should see what my heart can sing:\r\nAll that Love hath done to me\r\nBuilt into stone, a visible glee;\r\nMarble carried to gleaming height\r\nAs moved aloft by inward delight;\r\nNot as with toil of chisels hewn,\r\nBut seeming poised in a mighty tune.\r\nFor of all those who have been known\r\nTo lodge with our kind host, the sun,\r\nI envy one for just one thing:\r\nIn Cordova of the Moors\r\nThere dwelt a passion-minded King,\r\nWho set great bands of marble-hewers\r\nTo fashion his heart's thanksgiving\r\nIn a tall palace, shapen so\r\nAll the wondering world might know\r\nThe joy he had of his Moorish lass.\r\nHis love, that brighter and larger was\r\nThan the starry places, into firm stone\r\nHe sent, as if the stone were glass\r\nFired and into beauty blown.\r\nSolemn and invented gravely\r\nIn its bulk the fabric stood,\r\nEven as Love, that trusteth bravely\r\nIn its own exceeding good\r\nTo be better than the waste\r\nOf time's devices; grandly spaced,\r\nSeriously the fabric stood.\r\nBut over it all a pleasure went\r\nOf carven delicate ornament,\r\nWreathing up like ravishment,\r\nMentioning in sculptures twined\r\nThe blitheness Love hath in his mind;\r\nAnd like delighted senses were\r\nThe windows, and the columns there\r\nMade the following sight to ache\r\nAs the heart that did them make.\r\nWell I can see that shining song\r\nFlowering there, the upward throng\r\nOf porches, pillars and windowed walls,\r\nSpires like piercing panpipe calls,\r\nUp to the roof's snow-cloud flight;\r\nAll glancing in the Spanish light\r\nWhite as water of arctic tides,\r\nSave an amber dazzle on sunny sides.\r\nYou had said, the radiant sheen\r\nOf that palace might have been\r\nA young god's fantasy, ere he came\r\nHis serious worlds and suns to frame;\r\nSuch an immortal passion\r\nQuiver'd among the slim hewn stone.\r\nAnd in the nights it seemed a jar\r\nCut in the substance of a star,\r\nWherein a wine, that will be poured\r\nSome time for feasting Heaven, was stored.\r\nBut within this fretted shell,\r\nThe wonder of Love made visible,\r\nThe King a private gentle mood\r\nThere placed, of pleasant quietude.\r\nFor right amidst there was a court,\r\nWhere always musk'd silences\r\nListened to water and to trees;\r\nAnd herbage of all fragrant sort, - \r\nLavender, lad's-love, rosemary,\r\nBasil, tansy, centaury, - \r\nWas the grass of that orchard, hid\r\nLove's amazements all amid.\r\nJarring the air with rumour cool,\r\nSmall fountains played into a pool\r\nWith sound as soft as the barley's hiss\r\nWhen its beard just sprouting is;\r\nWhence a young stream, that trod on moss,\r\nPrettily rimpled the court across.\r\nAnd in the pool's clear idleness,\r\nMoving like dreams through happiness,\r\nShoals of small bright fishes were;\r\nIn and out weed-thickets bent\r\nPerch and carp, and sauntering went\r\nWith mounching jaws and eyes a-stare;\r\nOr on a lotus leaf would crawl,\r\nA brinded loach to bask and sprawl,\r\nTasting the warm sun ere it dipt\r\nInto the water; but quick as fear\r\nBack his shining brown head slipt\r\nTo crouch on the gravel of his lair,\r\nWhere the cooled sunbeams broke in wrack,\r\nSpilt shatter'd gold about his back.\r\nSo within that green-veiled air,\r\nWithin that white-walled quiet, where\r\nInnocent water thought aloud, - \r\nChildish prattle that must make\r\nThe wise sunlight with laughter shake\r\nOn the leafage overbowed, - \r\nOften the King and his love-lass\r\nLet the delicious hours pass.\r\nAll the outer world could see\r\nGraved and sawn amazingly\r\nTheir love's delighted riotise,\r\nFixt in marble for all men's eyes;\r\nBut only these twain could abide\r\nIn the cool peace that withinside\r\nThrilling desire and passion dwelt;\r\nThey only knew the still meaning spelt\r\nBy Love's flaming script, which is\r\nGod's word written in ecstasies.\n\r\nAnd where is now that palace gone,\r\nAll the magical skill'd stone,\r\nAll the dreaming towers wrought\r\nBy Love as if no more than thought\r\nThe unresisting marble was?\r\nHow could such a wonder pass?\r\nAh, it was but built in vain\r\nAgainst the stupid horns of Rome,\r\nThat pusht down into the common loam\r\nThe loveliness that shone in Spain.\r\nBut we have raised it up again!\r\nA loftier palace, fairer far,\r\nIs ours, and one that fears no war.\r\nSafe in marvellous walls we are;\r\nWondering sense like builded fires,\r\nHigh amazement of desires,\r\nDelight and certainty of love,\r\nClosing around, roofing above\r\nOur unapproacht and perfect hour\r\nWithin the splendours of love's power.",

And, like the flush\r\n That dyes Sahara to its lifeless verge,\r\n His brows' bright brass flamed into sudden crimson;\r\n And his great spear leapt upward, lightning-like,\r\n Shaking a dreadful thunder in the air;\r\n Spun betwixt earth and sky, bright as a berg\r\n That hoards the sunlight in a myriad spires,\r\n Crashed: and struck echo through an army's heart.\r\n Then paused Goliath, and stared down again.\r\n And fleet-foot Fear from rolling orbs perceived\r\n Steadfast, unharmed, a stooping shepherd-boy\r\n Frowning upon the target of his face.\r\n And wrath tossed suddenly up once more his hand;\r\n And a deep groan grieved all his strength in him.\r\n He breathed; and, lost in dazzling darkness, prayed - \r\n Besought his reins, his gloating gods, his youth:\r\n And turned to smite what he no more could see.\r\n Then sped the singing pebble-messenger,\r\n The chosen of the Lord from Israel's brooks,\r\n Fleet to its mark, and hollowed a light path\r\n Down to the appalling Babel of his brain.\r\n And like the smoke of dreaming Souffri're\r\n Dust rose in cloud, spread wide, slow silted down\r\n Softly all softly on his armour's blaze.\n",

canyons,\r\nAnd silver falling from eave and tree.\n\r\nOne, from his high bright window, looking down,\r\nPeers like a dreamer over the rain-bright town,\r\nAnd thinks its towers are like a dream.\r\nThe western windows flame in the sun's last flare,\r\nPale roofs begin to gleam.\n\r\nLooking down from a window high in a wall\r\nHe sees us all;\r\nLifting our pallid faces towards the rain,\r\nSearching the sky, and going our ways again,\r\nStanding in doorways, waiting under the trees . . .\r\nThere, in the high bright window he dreams, and sees\r\nWhat we are blind to, we who mass and crowd\r\nFrom wall to wall in the darkening of a cloud.\n\r\nThe gulls drift slowly above the city of towers,\r\nOver the roofs to the darkening sea they fly;\r\nNight falls swiftly on an evening of rain.\r\nThe yellow lamps wink one by one again.\r\nThe towers reach higher and blacker against the sky.\n\n\r\nIII.\n\r\nOne, where the pale sea foamed at the yellow sand,\r\nWith wave upon slowly shattering wave,\r\nTurned to the city of towers as evening fell;\r\nAnd slowly walked by the darkening road toward it;\r\nAnd saw how the towers darkened against the sky;\r\nAnd across the distance heard the toll of a bell.\n\r\nAlong the darkening road he hurried alone,\r\nWith his eyes cast down,\r\nAnd thought how the streets were hoarse with a tide of people,\r\nWith clamor of voices, and numberless faces . . .\r\nAnd it seemed to him, of a sudden, that he would drown\r\nHere in the quiet of evening air,\r\nThese empty and voiceless places . . .\r\nAnd he hurried towards the city, to enter there.\n\r\nAlong the darkening road, between tall trees\r\nThat made a sinister whisper, loudly he walked.\r\nBehind him, sea-gulls dipped over long grey seas.\r\nBefore him, numberless lovers smiled and talked.\r\nAnd death was observed with sudden cries,\r\nAnd birth with laughter and pain.\r\nAnd the trees grew taller and blacker against the skies\r\nAnd night came down again.\n\n\r\nIV.\n\r\nUp high black walls, up sombre terraces,\r\nClinging like luminous birds to the sides of cliffs,\r\nThe yellow lights went climbing towards the sky.\r\nFrom high black walls, gleaming vaguely with rain,\r\nEach yellow light looked down like a golden eye.\n\r\nThey trembled from coign to coign, and tower to tower,\r\nAlong high terraces quicker than dream they flew.\r\nAnd some of them steadily glowed, and some soon vanished,\r\nAnd some strange shadows threw.\n\r\nAnd behind them all the ghosts of thoughts went moving,\r\nRestlessly moving in each lamplit room,\r\nFrom chair to mirror, from mirror to fire;\r\nFrom some, the light was scarcely more than a gloom:\r\nFrom some, a dazzling desire.\n\r\nAnd there was one, beneath black eaves, who thought,\r\nCombing with lifted arms her golden hair,\r\nOf the lover who hurried towards her through the night;\r\nAnd there was one who dreamed of a sudden death\r\nAs she blew out her light.\n\r\nAnd there was one who turned from clamoring streets,\r\nAnd walked in lamplit gardens among black trees,\r\nAnd looked at the windy sky,\r\nAnd thought with terror how stones and roots would freeze\r\nAnd birds in the dead boughs cry . . .\n\r\nAnd she hurried back, as snow fell, mixed with rain,\r\nTo mingle among the crowds again,\r\nTo jostle beneath blue lamps along the street;\r\nAnd lost herself in the warm bright coiling dream,\r\nWith a sound of murmuring voices and shuffling feet.\n\r\nAnd one, from his high bright window looking down\r\nOn luminous chasms that cleft the basalt town,\r\nHearing a sea-like murmur rise,\r\nDesired to leave his dream, descend from the tower,\r\nAnd drown in waves of shouts and laughter and cries.\n\n\r\nV.\n\r\nThe snow floats down upon us, mingled with rain . . .\r\nIt eddies around pale lilac lamps, and falls\r\nDown golden-windowed walls.\r\nWe were all born of flesh, in a flare of pain,\r\nWe do not remember the red roots whence we rose,\r\nBut we know that we rose and walked, that after a while\r\nWe shall lie down again.\n\r\nThe snow floats down upon us, we turn, we turn,\r\nThrough gorges filled with light we sound and flow . . .\r\nOne is struck down and hurt, we crowd about him,\r\nWe bear him away, gaze after his listless body;\r\nBut whether he lives or dies we do not know.\n\r\nOne of us sings in the street, and we listen to him;\r\nThe words ring over us like vague bells of sorrow.\r\nHe sings of a house he lived in long ago.\r\nIt is strange; this house of dust was the house I lived in;\r\nThe house you lived in, the house that all of us know.\r\nAnd coiling slowly about him, and laughing at him,\r\nAnd throwing him pennies, we bear away\r\nA mournful echo of other times and places,\r\nAnd follow a dream . . . a dream that will not stay.\n\r\nDown long broad flights of lamplit stairs we flow;\r\nNoisy, in scattered waves, crowding and shouting;\r\nIn broken slow cascades.\r\nThe gardens extend before us . . . We spread out swiftly;\r\nTrees are above us, and darkness. The canyon fades . . .\n\r\nAnd we recall, with a gleaming stab of sadness,\r\nVaguely and incoherently, some dream\r\nOf a world we came from, a world of sun-blue hills . . .\r\nA black wood whispers around us, green eyes gleam;\r\nSomeone cries in the forest, and someone kills.\n\r\nWe flow to the east, to the white-lined shivering sea;\r\nWe reach to the west, where the whirling sun went down;\r\nWe close our eyes to music in bright cafees.\r\nWe diverge from clamorous streets to streets that are silent.\r\nWe loaf where the wind-spilled fountain plays.\n\r\nAnd, growing tired, we turn aside at last,\r\nRemember our secret selves, seek out our towers,\r\nLay weary hands on the banisters, and climb;\r\nClimbing, each, to his little four-square dream\r\nOf love or lust or beauty or death or crime.\n\n\r\nVI.\n\r\nOver the darkened city, the city of towers,\r\nThe city of a thousand gates,\r\nOver the gleaming terraced roofs, the huddled towers,\r\nOver a somnolent whisper of loves and hates,\r\nThe slow wind flows, drearily streams and falls,\r\nWith a mournful sound down rain-dark walls.\r\nOn one side purples the lustrous dusk of the sea,\r\nAnd dreams in white at the city's feet;\r\nOn one side sleep the plains, with heaped-up hills.\r\nOaks and beeches whisper in rings about it.\r\nAbove the trees are towers where dread bells beat.\n\r\nThe fisherman draws his streaming net from the sea\r\nAnd sails toward the far-off city, that seems\r\nLike one vague tower.\r\nThe dark bow plunges to foam on blue-black waves,\r\nAnd shrill rain seethes like a ghostly music about him\r\nIn a quiet shower.\n\r\nRain with a shrill sings on the lapsing waves;\r\nRain thrills over the roofs again;\r\nLike a shadow of shifting silver it crosses the city;\r\nThe lamps in the streets are streamed with rain;\r\nAnd sparrows complain beneath deep eaves,\r\nAnd among whirled leaves\r\nThe sea-gulls, blowing from tower to lower tower,\r\nFrom wall to remoter wall,\r\nSkim with the driven rain to the rising sea-sound\r\nAnd close grey wings and fall . . .\n\r\n. . .

'\r\nA chorus of elfin voices blowing about me\r\nWeaves to a babel of sound. Each cries a secret.\r\nI run among them, reach out vain hands, and drown.\n\r\n'I am the one who stood beside you and smiled,\r\nThinking your face so strangely young . . . '\r\n'I am the one who loved you but did not dare.'\r\n'I am the one you followed through crowded streets,\r\nThe one who escaped you, the one with red-gleamed hair.'\n\r\n'I am the one you saw to-day, who fell\r\nSenseless before you, hearing a certain bell:\r\nA bell that broke great memories in my brain.'\r\n'I am the one who passed unnoticed before you,\r\nInvisible, in a cloud of secret pain.'\n\r\n'I am the one who suddenly cried, beholding\r\nThe face of a certain man on the dazzling screen.\r\nThey wrote me that he was dead.

And it was so.'\n\n\r\nWeave, weave, weave, you streaks of rain!\r\nI am dissolved and woven again . . .\r\nThousands of faces rise and vanish before me.\r\nThousands of voices weave in the rain.\n\r\n'I am the one who rode beside you, blinking\r\nAt a dazzle of golden lights.\r\nTempests of music swept me: I was thinking\r\nOf the gorgeous promise of certain nights:\r\nOf the woman who suddenly smiled at me this day,\r\nSmiled in a certain delicious sidelong way,\r\nAnd turned, as she reached the door,\r\nTo smile once more . . .\r\nHer hands are whiter than snow on midnight water.\r\nHer throat is golden and full of golden laughter,\r\nHer eyes are strange as the stealth of the moon\r\nOn a night in June . . .\r\nShe runs among whistling leaves; I hurry after;\r\nShe dances in dreams over white-waved water;\r\nHer body is white and fragrant and cool,\r\nMagnolia petals that float on a white-starred pool . . .\r\nI have dreamed of her, dreaming for many nights\r\nOf a broken music and golden lights,\r\nOf broken webs of silver, heavily falling\r\nBetween my hands and their white desire:\r\nAnd dark-leaved boughs, edged with a golden radiance,\r\nDipping to screen a fire . . .\r\nI dream that I walk with her beneath high trees,\r\nBut as I lean to kiss her face,\r\nShe is blown aloft on wind, I catch at leaves,\r\nAnd run in a moonless place;\r\nAnd I hear a crashing of terrible rocks flung down,\r\nAnd shattering trees and cracking walls,\r\nAnd a net of intense white flame roars over the town,\r\nAnd someone cries; and darkness falls . . .\r\nBut now she has leaned and smiled at me,\r\nMy veins are afire with music,\r\nHer eyes have kissed me, my body is turned to light;\r\nI shall dream to her secret heart tonight . . . '\n\r\nHe rises and moves away, he says no word,\r\nHe folds his evening paper and turns away;\r\nI rush through the dark with rows of lamplit faces;\r\nFire bells peal, and some of us turn to listen,\r\nAnd some sit motionless in their accustomed places.\n\r\nCold rain lashes the car-roof, scurries in gusts,\r\nStreams down the windows in waves and ripples of lustre;\r\nThe lamps in the streets are distorted and strange.\r\nSomeone takes his watch from his pocket and yawns.\r\nOne peers out in the night for the place to change.\n\r\nRain . . . rain . . . rain . . . we are buried in rain,\r\nIt will rain forever, the swift wheels hiss through water,\r\nPale sheets of water gleam in the windy street.\r\nThe pealing of bells is lost in a drive of rain-drops.\r\nRemote and hurried the great bells beat.\n\r\n'I am the one whom life so shrewdly betrayed,\r\nMisfortune dogs me, it always hunted me down.\r\nAnd to-day the woman I love lies dead.\r\nI gave her roses, a ring with opals;\r\nThese hands have touched her head.\n\r\n'I bound her to me in all soft ways,\r\nI bound her to me in a net of days,\r\nYet now she has gone in silence and said no word.\r\nHow can we face these dazzling things, I ask you?\r\nThere is no use: we cry: and are not heard.\n\r\n'They cover a body with roses . . .

Wind in an enormous brain\r\nBlowing dark thoughts like fallen leaves . . .\r\nThe wind shrieks, the wind grieves;\r\nIt dashes the leaves on walls, it whirls then again;\r\nAnd the enormous sleeper vaguely and stupidly dreams\r\nAnd desires to stir, to resist a ghost of pain.\n\r\nOne, whom the city imprisoned because of his cunning,\r\nWho dreamed for years in a tower,\r\nSeizes this hour\r\nOf tumult and wind. He files through the rusted bar,\r\nLeans his face to the rain, laughs up at the night,\r\nSlides down the knotted sheet, swings over the wall,\r\nTo fall to the street with a cat-like fall,\r\nSlinks round a quavering rim of windy light,\r\nAnd at last is gone,\r\nLeaving his empty cell for the pallor of dawn . . .\n\r\nThe mother whose child was buried to-day\r\nTurns her face to the window; her face is grey;\r\nAnd all her body is cold with the coldness of rain.\r\nHe would have grown as easily as a tree,\r\nHe would have spread a pleasure of shade above her,\r\nHe would have been his father again . . .\r\nHis growth was ended by a freezing invisible shadow.\r\nShe lies, and does not move, and is stabbed by the rain.\n\r\nWind, wind, wind; we toss and dream;\r\nWe dream we are clouds and stars, blown in a stream:\r\nWindows rattle above our beds;\r\nWe reach vague-gesturing hands, we lift our heads,\r\nHear sounds far off, and dream, with quivering breath,\r\nOur curious separate ways through life and death.\n\n\r\nVIII.\n\r\nThe white fog creeps from the cold sea over the city,\r\nOver the pale grey tumbled towers, \r\nAnd settles among the roofs, the pale grey walls.\r\nAlong damp sinuous streets it crawls,\r\nCurls like a dream among the motionless trees\r\nAnd seems to freeze.\n\r\nThe fog slips ghostlike into a thousand rooms,\r\nWhirls over sleeping faces,\r\nSpins in an atomy dance round misty street lamps;\r\nAnd blows in cloudy waves over open spaces . . .\n\r\nAnd one from his high window, looking down,\r\nPeers at the cloud-white town,\r\nAnd thinks its island towers are like a dream . . .\r\nIt seems an enormous sleeper, within whose brain\r\nLaborious shadows revolve and break and gleam.\n\n",

Pouring her silver through that barren flower\r\nOf silver frost, until it filled and whitened\r\nA room where two small children waited, frightened\r\nAt the pale ghost of light that hour by hour\r\nStared at them till though fear slept not they slept.\r\nAnd when that white ghost from the window crept,\r\nAnd day came and they woke and saw all plain,\r\nThough still the frost-flower blinded the window-pane,\r\nAnd touched their mother and touched her hand in vain,\r\nAnd wondered why she woke not when they woke;\r\nAnd wondered what it was their sleep that broke\r\nWhen hand in hand they stared and stared, so frightened;\r\nThey feared and waited, and waited all day long\r\nWhile all the shadows went and the day brightened,\r\nAll the ill shadows but one shadow strong.\n\r\nOutside were busy feet and human speech\r\nAnd daily cries and horns. Maybe they heard,\r\nPainfully wondering still, and each to each\r\nLeaning, and listening if their mother stirred--\r\nCold, cold,\r\nHungering as the long slow hours grew old,\r\nThough food within the cupboard idle lay\r\nBeyond their thought, or but beyond their reach.\r\nThe soft blue pigeons all the afternoon\r\nSunned themselves on the roof or rose at play,\r\nThen with the shrinking light fluttered away;\r\nAnd once more came the icy hearted moon,\r\nStaring down at the frightened children there\r\nThat could but shiver and stare.\n\r\n... How many hours, how many days, who knows?\r\nNeighbours there were who thought they had gone away\r\nTo return some luckier or luckless day.\r\nNo sound came from the room: the cold air froze\r\nThe very echo of the children's sighs.\r\nAnd what they saw within each other's eyes,\r\nOr heard each other's heart say as they peered\r\nAt the dead mother lying there, and feared\r\nThat she might wake, and then might never wake,\r\nWho knows, who knows?\r\nNone heard a living sound their silence break.\n\r\nIn those cold days and nights how many birds\r\nFlittering above the fields and streams all frozen\r\nWatched hungrily the tended flocks and herds--\r\nEarth's chosen nourished by earth's wise self-chosen!\r\nHow many birds suddenly stiffened and died\r\nWith no plaint cried,\r\nThe starved heart ceasing when the pale sun ceased!\r\nAnd when the new day stepped from the same cold East\r\nThe dead birds lay in the light on the snow-flecked field,\r\nTheir song and beautiful free winging stilled.\n\r\nI walked under snow-sprinkled hills at night,\r\nAnd starry sprinkled, skies deep blue and bright.\r\nThe keen wind thrust with his knife against the thin\r\nBreast of the wood as I went tingling by\r\nAnd heard a weak cheep-cheep--no more--the cry\r\nOf a bird that crouched the smitten wood within....\r\nBut no one heeded that sharp spiritual cry\r\nOf the two children in their misery,\r\nWhen in the cold and famished night death's shade\r\nMore terrible the moon's cold shadows made.\r\nHow was it none could hear\r\nThat bodiless crying, birdlike, sharp and clear?\n\r\nI cannot think what they, unanswered, thought\r\nWhen the night came again and shadows moved\r\nAs the moon through the ice-flower stared and roved,\r\nAnd that unyielding Shadow came again.\r\nThat Shadow came again unseen and caught\r\nThe children as they sat listening in vain,\r\nTheir starved hearts failing ere the Shadow removed.\r\nAnd when the new morn stepped from the same cold East\r\nThey lay unawakening in the barren light,\r\nTheir song and their imaginations bright,\r\nTheir pains and fears and all bewilderment ceased....\r\nWhile the brief sun gave\r\nNew beauty to the death-flower of the frost,\r\nAnd pigeons in the frore air swooped and tossed,\r\nAnd glad eyes were more glad and grave less grave.\n\r\nThere is not pity enough in heaven or earth,\r\nThere is not love enough, if children die\r\nLike famished birds--oh, less mercifully.\r\nA great wrong's done when such as these go forth\r\nInto the starless dark, broken and bruised,\r\nWith mind and sweet affection all confused,\r\nAnd horror closing round them as they go.\r\nThere is not pity enough!\n\r\nAnd I have made, children, these verses for you,\r\nLasting a little longer than your breath,\r\nBecause I have been haunted with your death;\r\nSo men are driven to things they hate to do.\r\nJesus, forgive us all our happiness,\r\nAs Thou dost blot out all our miseries.\n",

          "'Twas up in a land long famed for gold, where women were far and rare,\r\nTellus, the smith, had taken to wife a maiden amazingly fair;\r\nTellus, the brawny worker in iron, hairy and heavy of hand,\r\nSaw her and loved her and bore her away from the tribe of a Southern land;\r\nDeeming her worthy to queen his home and mother him little ones,\r\nThat the name of Tellus, the master smith, might live in his stalwart sons.\n\r\nNow there was little of law in the land, and evil doings were rife,\r\nAnd every man who joyed in his home guarded the fame of his wife;\r\nFor there were those of the silver tongue and the honeyed art to beguile,\r\nWho would cozen the heart from a woman's breast and damn her soul with a smile.\r\nAnd there were women too quick to heed a look or a whispered word,\r\nAnd once in a while a man was slain, and the ire of the King was stirred;\r\nSo far and wide he proclaimed his wrath, and this was the law he willed:\r\n\"That whosoever killeth a man, even shall he be killed.\"\n\r\nNow Tellus, the smith, he trusted his wife; his heart was empty of fear.\r\nHigh on the hill was the gleam of their hearth, a beacon of love and cheer.\r\nHigh on the hill they builded their bower, where the broom and the bracken meet;\r\nUnder a grave of oaks it was, hushed and drowsily sweet.\r\nHere he enshrined her, his dearest saint, his idol, the light of his eye;\r\nHer kisses rested upon his lips as brushes a butterfly.\r\nThe weight of her arms around his neck was light as the thistle down;\r\nAnd sweetly she studied to win his smile, and gently she mocked his frown.\r\nAnd when at the close of the dusty day his clangorous toil was done,\r\nShe hastened to meet him down the way all lit by the amber sun.\n\r\nTheir dove-cot gleamed in the golden light, a temple of stainless love;\r\nLike the hanging cup of a big blue flower was the topaz sky above.\r\nThe roses and lilies yearned to her, as swift through their throng she pressed;\r\nA little white, fragile, fluttering thing that lay like a child on his breast.\r\nThen the heart of Tellus, the smith, was proud, and sang for the joy of life,\r\nAnd there in the bronzing summertide he thanked the gods for his wife.\n\r\nNow there was one called Philo, a scribe, a man of exquisite grace,\r\nCarved like the god Apollo in limb, fair as Adonis in face;\r\nEager and winning in manner, full of such radiant charm,\r\nWomenkind fought for his favor and loved to their uttermost harm.\r\nSuch was his craft and his knowledge, such was his skill at the game,\r\nNever was woman could flout him, so be he plotted her shame.\r\nAnd so he drank deep of pleasure, and then it fell on a day\r\nHe gazed on the wife of Tellus and marked her out for his prey.\n\r\nTellus, the smith, was merry, and the time of the year it was June,\r\nSo he said to his stalwart helpers: \"Shut down the forge at noon.\r\nGo ye and joy in the sunshine, rest in the coolth of the grove,\r\nDrift on the dreamy river, every man with his love.\"\r\nThen to himself: \"Oh, Beloved, sweet will be your surprise;\r\nTo-day will we sport like children, laugh in each other's eyes;\r\nWeave gay garlands of poppies, crown each other with flowers,\r\nPull plump carp from the lilies, rifle the ferny bowers.\r\nTo-day with feasting and gladness the wine of Cyprus will flow;\r\nTo-day is the day we were wedded only a twelvemonth ago.\"\n\r\nThe larks trilled high in the heavens; his heart was lyric with joy;\r\nHe plucked a posy of lilies; he sped like a love-sick boy.\r\nHe stole up the velvety pathway - his cottage was sunsteeped and still;\r\nVines honeysuckled the window; softly he peeped o'er the sill.\r\nThe lilies dropped from his fingers; devils were choking his breath;\r\nRigid with horror, he stiffened; ghastly his face was as death.\r\nLike a nun whose faith in the Virgin is met with a prurient jibe,\r\nHe shrank - 'twas the wife of his bosom in the arms of Philo, the scribe.\n\r\nTellus went back to his smithy; he reeled like a drunken man;\r\nHis heart was riven with anguish; his brain was brooding a plan.\r\nStraight to his anvil he hurried; started his furnace aglow;\r\nHeated his iron and shaped it with savage and masterful blow.\r\nSparks showered over and round him; swiftly under his hand\r\nThere at last it was finished - a hideous and infamous Brand.\n\r\nThat night the wife of his bosom, the light of joy in her eyes,\r\nKissed him with words of rapture; but he knew that her words were lies.\r\nNever was she so beguiling, never so merry of speech\r\n(For passion ripens a woman as the sunshine ripens a peach).\r\nHe clenched his teeth into silence; he yielded up to her lure,\r\nThough he knew that her breasts were heaving from the fire of her paramour.\r\n\"To-morrow,\" he said, \"to-morrow\" - he wove her hair in a strand,\r\nTwisted it round his fingers and smiled as he thought of the Brand.\n\r\nThe morrow was come, and Tellus swiftly stole up the hill.\r\nButterflies drowsed in the noon-heat; coverts were sunsteeped and still.\r\nSoftly he padded the pathway unto the porch, and within\r\nHeard he the low laugh of dalliance, heard he the rapture of sin.\r\nKnew he her eyes were mystic with light that no man should see,\r\nNo man kindle and joy in, no man on earth save he.\r\nAnd never for him would it kindle. The bloodlust surged in his brain;\r\nThrough the senseless stone could he see them, wanton and warily fain.\r\nHorrible! Heaven he sought for, gained it and gloried and fell - \r\nOh, it was sudden - headlong into the nethermost hell. . . .\n\r\nWas this he, Tellus, this marble? Tellus . . . not dreaming a dream?\r\nAh! sharp-edged as a javelin, was that a woman's scream?\r\nWas it a door that shattered, shell-like, under his blow?\r\nWas it his saint, that strumpet, dishevelled and cowering low?\r\nWas it her lover, that wild thing, that twisted and gouged and tore?\r\nWas it a man he was crushing, whose head he beat on the floor?\r\nLaughing the while at its weakness, till sudden he stayed his hand - \r\nThrough the red ring of his madness flamed the thought of the Brand.\n\r\nThen bound he the naked Philo with thongs that cut in the flesh,\r\nAnd the wife of his bosom, fear-frantic, he gagged with a silken mesh,\r\nChoking her screams into silence; bound her down by the hair;\r\nDragged her lover unto her under her frenzied stare.\r\nIn the heat of the hearth-fire embers he heated the hideous Brand;\r\nTwisting her fingers open, he forced its haft in her hand.\r\nHe pressed it downward and downward; she felt the living flesh sear;\r\nShe saw the throe of her lover; she heard the scream of his fear.\r\nOnce, twice and thrice he forced her, heedless of prayer and shriek - \r\nOnce on the forehead of Philo, twice in the soft of his cheek.\r\nThen (for the thing was finished) he said to the woman: \"See\r\nHow you have branded your lover! Now will I let him go free.\"\r\nHe severed the thongs that bound him, laughing: \"Revenge is sweet\",\r\nAnd Philo, sobbing in anguish, feebly rose to his feet.\r\nThe man who was fair as Apollo, god-like in woman's sight,\r\nHideous now as a satyr, fled to the pity of night.\n\r\n Then came they before the Judgment Seat, and thus spoke the Lord of the Land:\r\n \"He who seeketh his neighbor's wife shall suffer the doom of the Brand.\r\n Brutish and bold on his brow be it stamped, deep in his cheek let it sear,\r\n That every man may look on his shame, and shudder and sicken and fear.\r\n He shall hear their mock in the market-place, their fleering jibe at the feast;\r\n He shall seek the caves and the shroud of night, and the fellowship of the beast.\r\n Outcast forever from homes of men, far and far shall he roam.\r\n Such be the doom, sadder than death, of him who shameth a home.\"",
          "Out of my heart, one treach'rous winter's day,\r\nI locked young Love and threw the key away.\r\nGrief, wandering widely, found the key,\r\nAnd hastened with it, straightway, back to me,\r\nWith Love beside him. He unlocked the door\r\nAnd bade Love enter with him there and stay.\r\nAnd so the twain abide for evermore.",

The cry\r\nStabbed heaven! England, the shattered ramparts fall!\r\nThen, like a trumpet shivering through the sky\r\nO, like white lightning rending the black pall\r\nOf heaven, an answer pealed: Her dead shall hear that call.\n\r\nThen came a distant light of great waves breaking\r\nThat brought the sunset on each crumbling crest,\r\nA rumour as of buried ages waking,\r\nAnd mighty spirits rising from their rest;\r\nThen ghostly clouds arose, with billowing breast,\r\nWhite clouds that turned to sails upon their way,\r\nRed clouds that burned like flags against the West,\r\nTill even the conquering fleet in silence lay\r\nDazed with that strange old light, and night grew bright as day.\n\r\nWe come to fight for Freedom! The great East\r\nHeard, and was rent asunder like a veil.\r\nHost upon host out of the night increased\r\nIts towering clouds and crowded zones of sail:\r\nEngland, our England, canst thou faint or fail?\r\nWe come to fight for Freedom yet once more!\r\nThis, this is ours at least! Count the great tale\r\nOf all these dead that rise to guard thy shore\r\nBy right of the red life they never feared to pour.\n\r\nWe come to fight for Freedom! On they came,\r\nOne cloud of beauty sweeping the wild sea;\r\nAnd there, through all their thousands, flashed like flame\r\nThat star-born signal of the Victory:\r\nDuty, that deathless lantern of the free;\r\nDuty, that makes a god of every man.\r\nAnd there was Nelson, watching silently\r\nAs through the phantom fleet the message ran;\r\nAnd his tall frigate rushed before the stormy van.\n\r\nNelson, our Nelson, frail and maimed and blind,\r\nStretched out his dead cold face against the foe:\r\nAnd England's Raleigh followed hard behind,\r\nWith all his eager fighting heart aglow;\r\nGlad, glad for England's sake once more to know\r\nThe old joy of battle and contempt of pain;\r\nGlad, glad to die, if England willed it so,\r\nThe traitor's and the coward's death again;\r\nBut hurl the world back now as once he hurled back Spain.\n\r\nAnd there were all those others, Drake and Blake,\r\nRodney and Howard, Byron, Collingwood;\r\nWith deathless eyes aflame for England's sake,\r\nAs on their ancient decks they proudly stood,--\r\nDecks washed of old with England's purplest blood;\r\nAnd there, once more, each rushing oaken side\r\nBared its dark-throated, thirsty, gleaming brood\r\nOf cannon, watched by laughing lads who died\r\nLong, long ago for England and her ancient pride.\n\r\nWe come to fight for England! The great sea\r\nIn a wild light of song began to break\r\nRound that tall phantom of the Victory\r\nAnd all the foam was music in her wake:\r\nShip after phantom ship, with guns a-rake\r\nAnd shot-rent flags a-stream from every mast\r\nMoved in a deepening splendour, not to make\r\nA shield for England of her own dead past;\r\nBut, with a living dream to arm her soul at last.\n\r\nWe come to die for England: through the hush\r\nOf gathered nations rose that regal cry,\r\nFrom naked oaken walls one word could crush\r\nIf those vast armoured throats dared to reply:\r\nBut there the most implacable enemy\r\nFelt his eyes fill with gladder, prouder tears,\r\nAs Nelson's calm eternal face went by,\r\nGazing beyond all perishable fears\r\nTo some diviner goal above the waste of years.\n\r\nThrough the hushed fleets the vision streamed away,\r\nThen slowly turned once more to that deep West,\r\nWhile voices cried, O, England, the new day\r\nIs dawning, but thy soul can take no rest.\n\r\nThy freedom and thy peace are only thine\r\nBy right of toil on every land and sea\r\nAnd by that crimson sacrificial wine\r\nOf thine own heart and thine own agony.\n\r\nPeace is not slumber. Peace, in every hour,\r\nThrobs like the heart of music. This alone\r\nCan save thy heritage and confirm that power\r\nWhereof the past is but the cushioned throne.\n\r\nLook to the fleet! Again and yet again,\r\nHear us who storm thy heart with this one cry.\r\nHear us, who cannot help, though fair and fain,\r\nTo hold thy seas before thee, and to die.\n\r\nLook to the fleet! Thy fleet, the first, last line:\r\nThe sword of Liberty, her strength, her shield,\r\nHer food, her life-blood! Britain, it is thine,\r\nHere, now, to hold that birth-right, or to yield.\n\r\nSo, through the dark, those phantom ships of old\r\nFaded, it seemed, through mists of blood and tears.\r\nSails turned to clouds, and slowly westward rolled\r\nThe sad returning pageant of the years.\r\nOn tides of light, where all our tumults cease,\r\nThrough that rich West, the Victory returned;\r\nAnd all the waves around her whispered \"peace,\"\r\nAnd from her mast no battle-message burned.\n\r\nLike clouds, like fragments of those fading skies,\r\nThe pageant passed, with all its misty spars,\r\nWhile the hushed nations raised their dreaming eyes\r\nTo that great light which brings the end of wars.\n\r\nShip after ship, in some strange glory drowned,\r\nCloud after cloud, was lost in that deep light\r\nEach with a sovran stillness haloed round.\r\nThen--that high fleet of stars led on the night.",

We weight the body, close\r\nIts eyes and heave it seaward whence it came,\r\nWhere the heel-headed dogfish barks it nose\r\nOn Ahab's void and forehead; and the name\r\nIs blocked in yellow chalk.\r\nSailors, who pitch this portent at the sea\r\nWhere dreadnaughts shall confess\r\nIts heel-bent deity,\r\nWhen you are powerless\r\nTo sand-bag this Atlantic bulwark, faced\r\nBy the earth-shaker, green, unwearied, chaste\r\nIn his steel scales: ask for no Orphean lute\r\nTo pluck life back. The guns of the steeled fleet\r\nRecoil and then repeat\r\nThe hoarse salute.\n\r\nII\n\r\nWhenever winds are moving and their breath\r\nHeaves at the roped-in bulwarks of this pier,\r\nThe terns and sea-gulls tremble at your death\r\nIn these home waters. Sailor, can you hear\r\nThe Pequod's sea wings, beating landward, fall\r\nHeadlong and break on our Atlantic wall\r\nOff 'Sconset, where the yawing S-boats splash\r\nThe bellbuoy, with ballooning spinnakers,\r\nAs the entangled, screeching mainsheet clears\r\nThe blocks: off Madaket, where lubbers lash\r\nThe heavy surf and throw their long lead squids\r\nFor blue-fish? Sea-gulls blink their heavy lids\r\nSeaward. The winds' wings beat upon the stones,\r\nCousin, and scream for you and the claws rush\r\nAt the sea's throat and wring it in the slush\r\nOf this old Quaker graveyard where the bones\r\nCry out in the long night for the hurt beast\r\nBobbing by Ahab's whaleboats in the East.\n\r\nIII\n\r\nAll you recovered from Poseidon died\r\nWith you, my cousin, and the harrowed brine\r\nIs fruitless on the blue beard of the god,\r\nStretching beyond us to the castles in Spain,\r\nNantucket's westward haven. To Cape Cod\r\nGuns, cradled on the tide,\r\nBlast the eelgrass about a waterclock\r\nOf bilge and backwash, roil the salt and sand\r\nLashing earth's scaffold, rock\r\nOur warships in the hand\r\nOf the great God, where time's contrition blues\r\nWhatever it was these Quaker sailors lost\r\nIn the mad scramble of their lives. They died\r\nWhen time was open-eyed,\r\nWooden and childish; only bones abide\r\nThere, in the nowhere, where their boats were tossed\r\nSky-high, where mariners had fabled news\r\nOf IS, the whited monster. What it cost\r\nThem is their secret. In the sperm-whale's slick\r\nI see the Quakers drown and hear their cry:\r\n\"If God himself had not been on our side,\r\nIf God himself had not been on our side,\r\nWhen the Atlantic rose against us, why,\r\nThen it had swallowed us up quick.\"\n\r\nIV\n\r\nThis is the end of the whaleroad and the whale\r\nWho spewed Nantucket bones on the thrashed swell\r\nAnd stirred the troubled waters to whirlpools\r\nTo send the Pequod packing off to hell:\r\nThis is the end of them, three-quarters fools,\r\nSnatching at straws to sail\r\nSeaward and seaward on the turntail whale,\r\nSpouting out blood and water as it rolls,\r\nSick as a dog to these Atlantic shoals:\r\nClamavimus, O depths. Let the sea-gulls wail\n\r\nFor water, for the deep where the high tide\r\nMutters to its hurt self, mutters and ebbs.\r\nWaves wallow in their wash, go out and out,\r\nLeave only the death-rattle of the crabs,\r\nThe beach increasing, its enormous snout\r\nSucking the ocean's side.\r\nThis is the end of running on the waves;\r\nWe are poured out like water. Who will dance\r\nThe mast-lashed master of Leviathans\r\nUp from this field of Quakers in their unstoned graves?\n\r\nV\n\r\nWhen the whale's viscera go and the roll\r\nOf its corruption overruns this world\r\nBeyond tree-swept Nantucket and Wood's Hole\r\nAnd Martha's Vineyard, Sailor, will your sword\r\nWhistle and fall and sink into the fat?\r\nIn the great ash-pit of Jehoshaphat\r\nThe bones cry for the blood of the white whale,\r\nThe fat flukes arch and whack about its ears,\r\nThe death-lance churns into the sanctuary, tears\r\nThe gun-blue swingle, heaving like a flail,\r\nAnd hacks the coiling life out: it works and drags\r\nAnd rips the sperm-whale's midriff into rags,\r\nGobbets of blubber spill to wind and weather,\r\nSailor, and gulls go round the stoven timbers\r\nWhere the morning stars sing out together\r\nAnd thunder shakes the white surf and dismembers\r\nThe red flag hammered in the mast-head. Hide,\r\nOur steel, Jonas Messias, in Thy side.\n\r\nVI\n\r\nOUR LADY OF WALSINGHAM\n\r\nThere once the penitents took off their shoes\r\nAnd then walked barefoot the remaining mile;\r\nAnd the small trees, a stream and hedgerows file\r\nSlowly along the munching English lane,\r\nLike cows to the old shrine, until you lose\r\nTrack of your dragging pain.\r\nThe stream flows down under the druid tree,\r\nShiloah's whirlpools gurgle and make glad\r\nThe castle of God. Sailor, you were glad\r\nAnd whistled Sion by that stream. But see:\n\r\nOur Lady, too small for her canopy,\r\nSits near the altar. There's no comeliness\r\nat all or charm in that expressionless\r\nFace with its heavy eyelids. As before,\r\nThis face, for centuries a memory,\r\nNon est species, neque decor,\r\nExpressionless, expresses God: it goes\r\nPast castled Sion. She knows what God knows,\r\nNot Calvary's Cross nor crib at Bethlehem\r\nNow, and the world shall come to Walsingham.\n\r\nVII\n\r\nThe empty winds are creaking and the oak\r\nsplatters and splatters on the cenotaph,\r\nThe boughs are trembling and a gaff\r\nBobs on the untimely stroke\r\nOf the greased wash exploding on a shoal-bell\r\nIn the old mouth of the Atlantic. It's well;\r\nAtlantic, you are fouled with the blue sailors,\r\nsea-monsters, upward angel, downward fish:\r\nUnmarried and corroding, spare of flesh\r\nMart once of supercilious, wing'd clippers,\r\nAtlantic, where your bell-trap guts its spoil\r\nYou could cut the brackish winds with a knife\r\nHere in Nantucket, and cast up the time\r\nWhen the Lord God formed man from the sea's slime\r\nAnd breathed into his face the breath of life,\r\nAnd blue-lung'd combers lumbered to the kill.\r\nThe Lord survives the rainbow of His will.",

          "The boat ploughed on. Now Alcatraz was past\r\nAnd all the grey waves flamed to red again\r\nAt the dead sun's last glimmer.

but life's hands\r\nHave given more constant gifts in changing lands;\r\nAnd when I count those gifts, I think them such\r\nAs no man's bounty could have bettered much:\r\nThe gift of country life, near hills and woods\r\nWhere happy waters sing in solitudes,\r\nThe gift of being near ships, of seeing each day\r\nA city of ships with great ships under weigh,\r\nThe great street paved with water, filled with shipping,\r\nAnd all the world's flags flying and seagulls dipping.\n\r\nYet when I am dust my penman may not know\r\nThose water-trampling ships which made me glow,\r\nBut think my wonder mad and fail to find,\r\nTheir glory, even dimly, from my mind,\r\nAnd yet they made me:\n\r\nnot alone the ships\r\nBut men hard-palmed from tallying-on to whips,\r\nThe two close friends of nearly twenty years\r\nSea-followers both, sea-wrestlers and sea-peers,\r\nWhose feet with mine wore many a bolthead bright\r\nTreading the decks beneath the riding light.\r\nYet death will make that warmth of friendship cold,\r\nAnd who'll know what one said and what one told,\r\nOur hearts' communion, and the broken spells\r\nWhen the loud call blew at the strike of bells?\r\nNo one, I know, yet let me be believed,\r\nA soul entirely known is life achieved.\n\r\nYears blank with hardship never speak a word\r\nLive in the soul to make the being stirred;\r\nTowns can be prisons where the spirit dulls\r\nAway from mates and ocean-wandering hulls,\r\nAway from all bright water and great hills\r\nAnd sheep-walks where the curlews cry their fills;\r\nAway in towns, where eyes have nought to see\r\nBut dead museums and miles of misery\r\nAnd floating life un-rooted from man's need\r\nAnd miles of fish-hooks baited to catch greed\r\nAnd life made wretched out of human ken\r\nAnd miles of shopping women served by men.\r\nSo, if the penman sums my London days,\r\nLet him but say that there were holy ways,\r\nDull Bloomsbury streets of dull brick mansions old\r\nWith stinking doors where women stood to scold\r\nAnd drunken waits at Christmas with their horn\r\nDroning the news, in snow, that Christ was born;\r\nAnd windy gas lamps and the wet roads shining\r\nAnd that old carol of the midnight whining,\r\nAnd that old room above the noisy slum\r\nWhere there was wine and fire and talk with some\r\nUnder strange pictures of the wakened soul\r\nTo whom this earth was but a burnt-out coal.\n\r\nO Time, bring back those midnights and those friends,\r\nThose glittering moments that a spirit lends,\r\nThat all may be imagined from the flash,\r\nThe cloud-hid god-game through the lightning gash;\r\nThose hours of stricken sparks from which men took\r\nLight to send out to men in song or book;\r\nThose friends who heard St. Pancras' bells strike two,\r\nYet stayed until the barber's cockerel crew,\r\nTalking of noble styles, the Frenchman's best,\r\nThe thought beyond great poets not expressed,\r\nThe glory of mood where human frailty failed,\r\nThe forts of human light not yet assailed,\r\nTill the dim room had mind and seemed to brood,\r\nBinding our wills to mental brotherhood;\r\nTill we became a college, and each night\r\nWas discipline and manhood and delight;\r\nTill our farewells and winding down the stairs\r\nAt each gray dawn had meaning that Time spares\r\nThat we, so linked, should roam the whole world round\r\nTeaching the ways our brooding minds had found,\r\nMaking that room our Chapter, our one mind\r\nWhere all that this world soiled should be refined.\n\r\nOften at night I tread those streets again\r\nAnd see the alleys glimmering in the rain,\r\nYet now I miss that sign of earlier tramps,\r\nA house with shadows of plane-boughs under lamps,\r\nThe secret house where once a beggar stood,\r\nTrembling and blind, to show his woe for food.\r\nAnd now I miss that friend who used to walk\r\nHome to my lodgings with me, deep in talk,\r\nWearing the last of night out in still streets\r\nTrodden by us and policemen on their beats\r\nAnd cats, but else deserted; now I miss\r\nThat lively mind and guttural laugh of his\r\nAnd that strange way he had of making gleam,\r\nLike something real, the art we used to dream.\r\nLondon has been my prison; but my books\r\nHills and great waters, labouring men and brooks,\r\nShips and deep friendships and remembered days\r\nWhich even now set all my mind ablaze,\r\nAs that June day when, in the red bricks' chinks\r\nI saw the old Roman ruins white with pinks\r\nAnd felt the hillside haunted even then\r\nBy not dead memory of the Roman men;\r\nAnd felt the hillside thronged by souls unseen\r\nWho knew the interest in me, and were keen\r\nThat man alive should understand man dead\r\nSo many centuries since the blood was shed,\r\nAnd quickened with strange hush because this comer\r\nSensed a strange soul alive behind the summer.\r\nThat other day on Ercall when the stones\r\nWere sunbleached white, like long unburied bones,\r\nWhile the bees droned and all the air was sweet\r\nFrom honey buried underneath my feet,\r\nHoney of purple heather and white clover\r\nSealed in its gummy bags till summer's over.\r\nThen other days by water, by bright sea,\r\nClear as clean glass, and my bright friend with me;\r\nThe cove clean bottomed where we saw the brown\r\nRed spotted plaice go skimming six feet down,\r\nAnd saw the long fronds waving, white with shells,\r\nWaving, unfolding, drooping, to the swells;\r\nThat sadder day when we beheld the great\r\nAnd terrible beauty of a Lammas spate\r\nRoaring white-mouthed in all the great cliff's gaps,\r\nHeadlong, tree-tumbling fury of collapse,\r\nWhile drenching clouds drove by and every sense\r\nWas water roaring or rushing or in offence,\r\nAnd mountain sheep stood huddled and blown gaps gleamed\r\nWhere torn white hair of torrents shook and streamed.\r\nThat sadder day when we beheld again\r\nA spate going down in sunshine after rain\r\nWhen the blue reach of water leaping bright\r\nWas one long ripple and clatter, flecked with white.\r\nAnd that far day, that never blotted page\r\nWhen youth was bright like flowers about old age,\r\nFair generations bringing thanks for life\r\nTo that old kindly man and trembling wife\r\nAfter their sixty years: Time never made\r\nA better beauty since the Earth was laid,\r\nThan that thanksgiving given to grey hair\r\nFor the great gift of life which brought them there.\n\r\nDays of endeavour have been good: the days\r\nRacing in cutters for the comrade's praise.\r\nThe day they led my cutter at the turn,\r\nYet could not keep the lead, and dropped astern;\r\nThe moment in the spurt when both boats' oars\r\nDipped in each other's wash, and throats grew hoarse,\r\nAnd teeth ground into teeth, and both strokes quickened\r\nLashing the sea, and gasps came, and hearts sickened,\r\nAnd coxswains damned us, dancing, banking stroke,\r\nTo put our weights on, though our hearts were broke,\r\nAnd both boats seemed to stick and sea seemed glue,\r\nThe tide a mill race we were struggling through;\r\nAnd every quick recover gave us squints\r\nOf them still there, and oar-tossed water-glints,\r\nAnd cheering came, our friends, our foemen cheering,\r\nA long, wild, rallying murmur on the hearing,\r\n'Port Fore!' and 'Starboard Fore!' 'Port Fore' 'Port Fore,'\r\n'Up with her,' 'Starboard'; and at that each oar\r\nLightened, though arms were bursting, and eyes shut,\r\nAnd the oak stretchers grunted in the strut,\r\nAnd the curse quickened from the cox, our bows\r\nCrashed, and drove talking water, we made vows,\r\nChastity vows and temperance; in our pain\r\nWe numbered things we'd never eat again\r\nIf we could only win; then came the yell\r\n'Starboard,' 'Port Fore,' and then a beaten bell\r\nRung as for fire to cheer us. 'Now.' Oars bent,\r\nSoul took the looms now body's bolt was spent,\r\n'Damn it, come on now.' 'On now,' 'On now,' 'Starboard.'\r\n'Port Fore,' 'Up with her, Port'; each cutter harboured\r\nTen eye-shut painsick strugglers, 'Heave, oh heave,'\r\nCatcalls waked echoes like a shrieking sheave.\r\n'Heave,' and I saw a back, then two. 'Port Fore,'\r\n'Starboard,' 'Come on'; I saw the midship oar,\r\nAnd knew we had done them. 'Port Fore,' 'Starboard,' 'Now.'\r\nI saw bright water spurting at their bow,\r\nTheir cox' full face an instant. They were done.\r\nThe watchers' cheering almost drowned the gun.\r\nWe had hardly strength to toss our oars; our cry\r\nCheering the losing cutter was a sigh.\n\r\nOther bright days of action have seemed great:\r\nWild days in a pampero off the Plate;\r\nGood swimming days, at Hog Back or the Coves\r\nWhich the young gannet and the corbie loves;\r\nSurf-swimming between rollers, catching breath\r\nBetween the advancing grave and breaking death,\r\nThen shooting up into the sunbright smooth\r\nTo watch the advancing roller bare her tooth;\r\nAnd days of labour also, loading, hauling;\r\nLong days at winch or capstan, heaving, pawling;\r\nThe days with oxen, dragging stone from blasting,\r\nAnd dusty days in mills, and hot days masting.\r\nTrucking on dust-dry deckings smooth like ice,\r\nAnd hunts in mighty wool-racks after mice;\r\nMornings with buckwheat when the fields did blanch\r\nWith White Leghorns come from the chicken ranch;\r\nDays near the spring upon the sunburnt hill,\r\nPlying the maul or gripping tight the drill;\r\nDelights of work most real, delights that change\r\nThe headache life of towns to rapture strange\r\nNot known by townsmen, nor imagined; health\r\nThat puts new glory upon mental wealth\r\nAnd makes the poor man rich.\n\r\nBut that ends, too.\r\nHealth, with its thoughts of life; and that bright view,\r\nThat sunny landscape from life's peak, that glory,\r\nAnd all a glad man's comments on life's story,\r\nAnd thoughts of marvellous towns and living men,\r\nAnd what pens tell, and all beyond the pen,\r\nEnd, and are summed in words so truly dead\r\nThey raise no image of the heart and head,\r\nThe life, the man alive, the friend we knew,\r\nThe minds ours argued with or listened to,\r\nNone; but are dead, and all life's keenness, all,\r\nIs dead as print before the funeral;\r\nEven deader after, when the dates are sought,\r\nAnd cold minds disagree with what we thought.\n\r\nThis many-pictured world of many passions\r\nWears out the nations as a woman fashions,\r\nAnd what life is is much to very few;\r\nMen being so strange, so mad, and what men do\r\nSo good to watch or share; but when men count\r\nThose hours of life that were a bursting fount\r\nSparkling the dusty heart with living springs,\r\nThere seems a world, beyond our earthly things,\r\nGated by golden moments, each bright time\r\nOpening to show the city white like lime,\r\nHigh-towered and many-peopled. This made sure,\r\nWork that obscures those moments seems impure,\r\nMaking our not-returning time of breath\r\nDull with the ritual and records of death,\r\nThat frost of fact by which our wisdom gives\r\nCorrectly stated death to all that lives.\n\r\nBest trust the happy moments. What they gave\r\nMakes man less fearful of the certain grave,\r\nAnd gives his work compassion and new eyes.\r\nThe days that make us happy make us wise.",

          "Was it a dream?--that crowded concert-room\r\nIn Bath; that sea of ruffles and laced coats;\r\nAnd William Herschel, in his powdered wig,\r\nWaiting upon the platform, to conduct\r\nHis choir and Linley's orchestra? He stood\r\nTapping his music-rest, lost in his own thoughts\r\nAnd (did I hear or dream them?) all were mine:\n\r\nMy periwig's askew, my ruffle stained\r\nWith grease from my new telescope!\r\n Ach, to-morrow\r\nHow Caroline will be vexed, although she grows\r\nAlmost as bad as I, who cannot leave\r\nMy work-shop for one evening.\r\nI must give\r\nOne last recital at St. Margaret's,\r\nAnd then--farewell to music.\r\n Who can lead\r\nTwo lives at once?\r\n Yet--it has taught me much,\r\nThrown curious lights upon our world, to pass\r\nFrom one life to another. Much that I took\r\nFor substance turns to shadow. I shall see\r\nNo throngs like this again; wring no more praise\r\nOut of their hearts; forego that instant joy\r\n--Let those who have not known it count it vain--\r\nWhen human souls at once respond to yours.\r\nHere, on the brink of fortune and of fame,\r\nAs men account these things, the moment comes\r\nWhen I must choose between them and the stars;\r\nAnd I have chosen.\r\n Handel, good old friend,\r\nWe part to-night. Hereafter, I must watch\r\nThat other wand, to which the worlds keep time.\n\r\nWhat has decided me? That marvelous night\r\nWhen--ah, how difficult it will be to guide,\r\nWith all these wonders whirling through my brain!--\r\nAfter a Pump-room concert I came home\r\nHot-foot, out of the fluttering sea of fans,\r\nCoquelicot-ribboned belles and periwigged beaux,\r\nTo my Newtonian telescope.\r\n The design\r\nWas his; but more than half the joy my own,\r\nBecause it was the work of my own hand,\r\nA new one, with an eye six inches wide,\r\nBetter than even the best that Newton made.\r\nThen, as I turned it on the Gemini,\r\nAnd the deep stillness of those constant lights,\r\nCastor and Pollux, lucid pilot-stars,\r\nBegan to calm the fever of my blood,\r\nI saw, O, first of all mankind I saw\r\nThe disk of my new planet gliding there\r\nBeyond our tumults, in that realm of peace.\n\r\nWhat will they christen it? Ach--not Herschel, no!\r\nNor Georgium Sidus, as I once proposed;\r\nAlthough he scarce could lose it, as he lost\r\nThat world in 'seventy-six.\r\n Indeed, so far\r\nFrom trying to tax it, he has granted me\r\nHow much?--two hundred golden pounds a year,\r\nIn the great name of science,--half the cost\r\nOf one state-coach, with all those worlds to win!\r\nWell--well--we must be grateful. This mad king\r\nHas done far more than all the worldly-wise,\r\nWho'll charge even this to madness.\r\nI believe\r\nOne day he'll have me pardoned for that...crime,\r\nWhen I escaped--deserted, some would say--\r\nFrom those drill-sergeants in my native land;\r\nDeserted drill for music, as I now\r\nDesert my music for the orchestral spheres.\r\nNo. This new planet is only new to man.\r\nHis majesty has done much. Yet, as my friend\r\nDeclared last night, \"Never did monarch buy\r\nHonour so cheaply\"; and--he has not bought it.\r\nI think that it should bear some ancient name,\r\nAnd wear it like a crown; some deep, dark name,\r\nLike Uranus, known to remoter gods.\n\r\nHow strange it seems--this buzzing concert-room!\r\nThere's Doctor Burney bowing and, behind him,\r\nHis fox-eyed daughter Fanny.\r\n Is it a dream,\r\nThese crowding midgets, dense as clustering bees\r\nIn some great bee-skep?\r\nNow, as I lift my wand,\r\nA silence grips them, and the strings begin,\r\nThrobbing. The faint lights flicker in gusts of sound.\r\nBefore me, glimmering like a crescent moon,\r\nThe dim half circle of the choir awaits\r\nIts own appointed time.\r\nBeside me now,\r\nWatching my wand, plump and immaculate\r\nFrom buckled shoes to that white bunch of lace\r\nUnder his chin, the midget tenor rises,\r\nMusic in hand, a linnet and a king.\r\nThe bullfinch bass, that other emperor,\r\nLeans back indifferently, and clears his throat\r\nAs if to say, \"This prelude leads to Me!\"\r\nWhile, on their own proud thrones, on either hand,\r\nThe sumptuously bosomed midget queens,\r\nContralto and soprano, jealously eye\r\nEach other's plumage.\r\nRound me the music throbs\r\nWith an immortal passion. I grow aware\r\nOf an appalling mystery.... We, this throng\r\nOf midgets, playing, listening, tense and still,\r\nAre sailing on a midget ball of dust\r\nWe call our planet; will have sailed through space\r\nTen thousand leagues before this music ends.\r\nWhat does it mean? Oh, God, what can it mean?--\r\nThis weird hushed ant-hill with a thousand eyes;\r\nThese midget periwigs; all those little blurs,\r\nTier over tier, of faces, masks of flesh,\r\nCorruptible, hiding each its hopes and dreams,\r\nIts tragi-comic dreams.\r\nAnd all this throng\r\nWill be forgotten, mixed with dust, crushed out,\r\nBefore this book of music is outworn\r\nOr that tall organ crumbles. Violins\r\nOutlast their players. Other hands may touch\r\nThat harpsichord; but ere this planet makes\r\nAnother threescore journeys round its sun,\r\nThese breathing listeners will have vanished. Whither?\r\nI watch my moving hands, and they grow strange!\r\nWhat is it moves this body? What am I?\r\nHow came I here, a ghost, to hear that voice\r\nOf infinite compassion, far away,\r\nAbove the throbbing strings, hark! Comfort ye...\n\r\nIf music lead us to a cry like this,\r\nI think I shall not lose it in the skies.\r\nI do but follow its own secret law\r\nAs long ago I sought to understand\r\nIts golden mathematics; taught myself\r\nThe way to lay one stone upon another,\r\nBefore I dared to dream that I might build\r\nMy Holy City of Song. I gave myself\r\nTo all its branches. How they stared at me,\r\nThose men of \"sensibility,\" when I said\r\nThat algebra, conic sections, fluxions, all\r\nPertained to music. Let them stare again.\r\nOld Kepler knew, by instinct, what I now\r\nDesire to learn. I have resolved to leave\r\nNo tract of heaven unvisited.\r\nTo-night\r\n--The music carries me back to it again!--\r\nI see beyond this island universe,\r\nBeyond our sun, and all those other suns\r\nThat throng the Milky Way, far, far beyond,\r\nA thousand little wisps, faint nebulae,\r\nLuminous fans and milky streaks of fire;\r\nSome like soft brushes of electric mist\r\nStreaming from one bright point; others that spread\r\nAnd branch, like growing systems; others discrete,\r\nKeen, ripe, with stars in clusters; others drawn back\r\nBy central forces into one dense death,\r\nThence to be kindled into fire, reborn,\r\nAnd scattered abroad once more in a delicate spray\r\nFaint as the mist by one bright dewdrop breathed\r\nAt dawn, and yet a universe like our own;\r\nEach wisp a universe, a vast galaxy\r\nWide as our night of stars.\r\nThe Milky Way\r\nIn which our sun is drowned, to these would seem\r\nLess than to us their faintest drift of haze;\r\nYet we, who are borne on one dark grain of dust\r\nAround one indistinguishable spark\r\nOf star-mist, lost in one lost feather of light,\r\nCan by the strength of our own thought, ascend\r\nThrough universe after universe; trace their growth\r\nThrough boundless time, their glory, their decay;\r\nAnd, on the invisible road of law, more firm\r\nThan granite, range through all their length and breadth,\r\nTheir height and depth, past, present and to come.\r\nSo, those who follow the great Work-master's law\r\nFrom small things up to great, may one day learn\r\nThe structure of the heavens, discern the whole\r\nWithin the part, as men through Love see God.\r\nOh, holy night, deep night of stars, whose peace\r\nDescends upon the troubled mind like dew,\r\nHealing it with the sense of that pure reign\r\nOf constant law, enduring through all change;\r\nShall I not, one day, after faithful years,\r\nFind that thy heavens are built on music, too,\r\nAnd hear, once more, above thy throbbing worlds\r\nThis voice of all compassion, Comfort ye,--\r\nYes--comfort ye, my people, saith your God?",

In the stark\r\nDanger of life at war, they lie so still,\r\nAll prostrate and defenceless, head by head ...\r\nAnd I remember Arras, and that hill\r\nWhere dumb with pain I stumbled among the dead.\n\r\n*****\n\r\nWe are going home.

          "I\n\r\nFit for perpetual worship is the power\r\nThat holds our bodies safely to the earth.\n\r\nWhen people talk of their domestic gods,\r\nThen privately I think of You.\n\r\nWe ride through space upon your shoulders\r\nConveniently and lightly set,\r\nAnd, so accustomed, we relax our hold,\r\nForget the gentle motion of your body -\r\nBut You do not forget.\n\r\nSometimes you breathe a little faster,\r\nOr move a muscle:\r\nThen we remember you, O Master.\n\n\r\nII\n\r\nWhen people meet in reverent groups\r\nAnd sing to their domestic God,\r\nYou, all the time, dear tyrant, (How I laugh!)\r\nCould, without effort, place your hand among them,\r\nAnd sprinkle them about the desert.\n\r\nBut all your ways are carefully ordered,\r\nFor you have never questioned duty.\r\nWe watch your everlasting combinations;\r\nWe call them Fate; we turn them to our pleasure,\r\nAnd when they most delight us, call them beauty.\n\n\r\nIII\n\r\nI rest my body on your grass,\r\nAnd let my brain repose in you;\r\nI feel these living moments pass,\r\nAnd, from within myself to those far places\r\nTo be imagined in your times and spaces,\r\nDeliberate the various acts you do: -\n\r\nSorting and re-arranging worlds of Matter\r\nKeenly and wisely. Thus you brought our earth\r\nThrough stages, and from purpose back to purpose,\r\nFrom fire to fog, to dust, to birth\r\nThrough beast to man, who led himself to brain -\r\nThen you invoked him back to dust again.\n\r\nBy leave of you he places stone on stone;\r\nHe scatters seed: you are at once the prop\r\nAmong the long roots of his fragile crop.\r\nYou manufacture for him, and insure\r\nHouse, harvest, implement and furniture,\r\nAnd hold them all secure.\n\n\r\nIV\n\r\nThe hill ... The trees ...

          "A little bird, with plumage brown,\r\nBeside my window flutters down,\r\nA moment chirps its little strain,\r\nTen taps upon my window-pane,\r\nAnd chirps again, and hops along,\r\nTo call my notice to its song;\r\nBut I work on, nor heed its lay,\r\nTill, in neglect, it flies away.\n\r\nSo birds of peace and hope and love\r\nCome fluttering earthward from above,\r\nTo settle on life's window-sills,\r\nAnd ease our load of earthly ills;\r\nBut we, in traffic's rush and din\r\nToo deep engaged to let them in,\r\nWith deadened heart and sense plod on,\r\nNor know our loss till they are gone.",
          "Here slow decay with creeping finger peels\r\nThe yellow plaster from the grimy walls,\r\nLike leprous lichen, day by day which falls,\r\nAnd, day by day, more rotting stone reveals!\r\nHere are old mournful squares through which there steals\r\nNo cheerful music, or the heedless calls\r\nOf laughing children; and the smoke, which crawls\r\nAcross the sky, the heavy silence seals!\n\r\nLean, blackened trees stretch up their withered boughs\r\nBehind the rusty railings, prison-bound,\r\nIn vain they seek the summer sunlight's gold\r\nIn which their long-dead fathers used to drowse:\r\nFor pallid terraces lie far around,\r\nIn gloomy sadness ever growing old.\n\r\n Ochey-les-Bains, 1917.",
          "As evening falls,\r\nAnd the yellow lights leap one by one\r\nAlong high walls;\r\nAnd along black streets that glisten as if with rain,\r\nThe muted city seems\r\nLike one in a restless sleep, who lies and dreams\r\nOf vague desires, and memories, and half-forgotten pain . . .\r\nAlong dark veins, like lights the quick dreams run,\r\nFlash, are extinguished, flash again,\r\nTo mingle and glow at last in the enormous brain\r\nAnd die away . . .\r\nAs evening falls,\r\nA dream dissolves these insubstantial walls,\r\nA myriad secretly gliding lights lie bare . . .\r\nThe lovers rise, the harlot combs her hair,\r\nThe dead man's face grows blue in the dizzy lamplight,\r\nThe watchman climbs the stair . . .\r\nThe bank defaulter leers at a chaos of figures,\r\nAnd runs among them, and is beaten down;\r\nThe sick man coughs and hears the chisels ringing;\r\nThe tired clown\r\nSees the enormous crowd, a million faces,\r\nMotionless in their places,\r\nReady to laugh, and seize, and crush and tear . . .\r\nThe dancer smooths her hair,\r\nLaces her golden slippers, and runs through the door\r\nTo dance once more,\r\nHearing swift music like an enchantment rise,\r\nFeeling the praise of a thousand eyes.\n\r\nAs darkness falls\r\nThe walls grow luminous and warm, the walls\r\nTremble and glow with the lives within them moving,\r\nMoving like music, secret and rich and warm.\r\nHow shall we live tonight? Where shall we turn?\r\nTo what new light or darkness yearn?\r\nA thousand winding stairs lead down before us;\r\nAnd one by one in myriads we descend\r\nBy lamplit flowered walls, long balustrades,\r\nThrough half-lit halls which reach no end.",
          "That is the earliest thing that I remember--\r\nThe narrow house in the long narrow street,\r\nDark rooms within and darkness out of doors\r\nWhere grasses in the garden lift in the wind,\r\nLong grasses clinging round unsteady feet.\r\nThe sunlight through one narrow passage pours,\r\nAs through the keyhole into a dusty room,\r\nStriking with a golden rod the greening gloom.\r\nThe tall, tall timber-stacks have yet been kind,\r\nLetting the sun fling his rod clear between,\r\nLest there should be no gold upon the green,\r\nAnd no light then for a child to dream upon,\r\nAnd day be of day's brightness all forlorn.\r\nI saw those timber piles first dark and tall,\r\nAnd then men clambered up, and stumbled down,\r\nEach with a heavy and long timber borne\r\nUpon broad shoulders, leather-covered, bent.\r\nHour after hour, day after day they went,\r\nUntil the piles were gone and a new sky\r\nStretched high and white above the garden wall.\r\nAnd then fresh piles crept slowly up and up,\r\nThe strong men staggering, more cruelly bowed,\r\nTill at last they lay idle on the top\r\nLooking down from their height on things so small,\r\nWhile I looked wondering and fearful up\r\nAt the strong men at rest on the new-built cloud.\r\nBut there was other gold than the sun's sparse gold--\r\nFlorence's hair, its brightness lying still\r\nUpon my mind as then upon the grass.\r\nNow the grass covers it and I am old,\r\nRemembering but her hair and that long grass,\r\nAnd the great wood-stacks threatening to fall--\r\nWhen all dark things will.",
          "\r\nI shall make beauty out of many things:\r\nLights, colours, motions, sky and earth and sea,\r\nThe soft unbosoming of all the springs\r\nWhich that inscrutable hand allows to me,\r\nOdours of flowers, sounds of smitten strings,\r\nThe voice of many a wind in many a tree,\r\nFields, rivers, moors, swift feet and floating wings,\r\nRocks, caves, and hills that stand and clouds that flee.\n\r\nMen also and women, beautiful and dear,\r\nShall come and pass and leave a fragrant breath;\r\nAnd my own heart, laughter and pain and fear,\r\nThe majesties of evil and of death;\r\nBut never, never shall my verses trace\r\nThe loveliness of your most lovely face.\n",
          "My dear Daddie bought a mansion\r\nFor to bring my Mammie to,\r\nIn a hat with a long feather,\r\nAnd a trailing gown of blue;\r\nAnd a company of fiddlers\r\nAnd a rout of maids and men\r\nDanced the clock round to the morning,\r\nIn a gay house-warming then.\r\nAnd when all the guests were gone, and\r\nAll was still as still can be,\r\nIn from the dark ivy hopped a\r\nWee small bird: and that was Me.",
          "I will not know when I am dead\r\nIf sun or moon is overhead;\r\nI'll stretch out flat without a sound\r\nInside a box beneath the ground,\r\nAnd never rise again to see\r\nBranches lifting on a tree,\r\nNor hear the song the finches sing\r\nIn the spring.\n\r\nI'll not, while sunny ages go,\r\nLift a hand or wag a toe;\r\nBut in a wooden box will be\r\nHidden for eternity\r\nFrom sea and sun, from sight and sound,\r\nFrom touch of people, voice of friend,\r\nFrom all that makes my heart to bound,\r\nDenying such an end:\r\nIt is so strange, I wonder why\r\nPeople die!\n\n",
          "The lanky hank of a she in the inn over there\r\nNearly killed me for asking the loan of a glass of beer:\r\nMay the devil grip the whey-faced slut by the hair,\r\nAnd beat bad manners out of her skin for a year.\n\r\nThat parboiled imp, with the hardest jaw you will see\r\nOn virtue's path, and a voice that would rasp the dead,\r\nCame roaring and raging the minute she looked at me,\r\nAnd threw me out of the house on the back of my head!\n\r\nIf I asked her master he'd give me a cask a day;\r\nBut she, with the beer at hand, not a gill would arrange!\r\nMay she marry a ghost and bear him a kitten, and may\r\nThe High King of Glory permit her to get the mange.\n",
          "What love is; how I love; how builders' clay\r\nBy love is lit into a golden spending;\r\nHow love calls beautiful ghosts back to the day;\r\nHow life because of love shall have no ending, \r\nThese with the dawn I have begun to sing,\r\nThese with the million-budded noon that's rising\r\nShall be a theme, with love's consent, to bring\r\nMy song to some imperishable devising.\r\nAnd may the petals of this garland fall\r\nOn every quarrel, and in fragrance bless\r\nOld friendship; and a little comfort all\r\nThe weary loves that walk the wilderness,\r\nWhile still my song I consecrate alone\r\nTo her who taking it shall take her own.\n",
          "When the corn 's all cut and the bright stalks shine\r\nLike the burnished spears of a field of gold;\r\nWhen the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine,\r\nAnd the frost comes white and the wind blows cold;\r\nThen it's heigho! fellows and hi-diddle-diddle,\r\nFor the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle.\n\r\nAnd you take a stalk that is straight and long,\r\nWith an expert eye to its worthy points,\r\nAnd you think of the bubbling strains of song\r\nThat are bound between its pithy joints--\r\nThen you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle,\r\nWith a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle.\n\r\nThen the strains that grow as you draw the bow\r\nO'er the yielding strings with a practised hand!\r\nAnd the music's flow never loud but low\r\nIs the concert note of a fairy band.\r\nOh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle\r\nTo the simple sweets of the corn-stalk fiddle.\n\r\nWhen the eve comes on, and our work is done,\r\nAnd the sun drops down with a tender glance,\r\nWith their hearts all prime for the harmless fun,\r\nCome the neighbor girls for the evening's dance,\r\nAnd they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle--\r\nMore time than tune--from the corn-stalk fiddle.\n\r\nThen brother Jabez takes the bow,\r\nWhile Ned stands off with Susan Bland,\r\nThen Henry stops by Milly Snow,\r\nAnd John takes Nellie Jones's hand,\r\nWhile I pair off with Mandy Biddle,\r\nAnd scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle.\n\r\n\"Salute your partners,\" comes the call,\r\n\"All join hands and circle round,\"\r\n\"Grand train back,\" and \"Balance all,\"\r\nFootsteps lightly spurn the ground.\r\n\"Take your lady and balance down the middle\"\r\nTo the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle.\n\r\nSo the night goes on and the dance is o'er,\r\nAnd the merry girls are homeward gone,\r\nBut I see it all in my sleep once more,\r\nAnd I dream till the very break of dawn\r\nOf an impish dance on a red-hot griddle\r\nTo the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle.",
          "\r\nYou are my sky; beneath your circling kindness\r\nMy meadows all take in the light and grow;\r\nLaugh with the joy you've given,\r\nThe joy you've given,\r\nAnd open in a thousand buds, and blow.\n\r\nBut when you are sombre, sad, averse, forgetful,\r\nHeavily veiled by clouds that brood with rain,\r\nDumbly I lie all shadowed,\r\nI lie all shadowed,\r\nAnd dumbly wait for you to shine again.",
          "O ye who sail Potomac's even tide\r\nTo Vernon's shades, our Chieftain's hallowed mound;\r\nOr who at distant shrines high paeans sound\r\nIn Alfred's cult, old England's morning pride;\r\nOr seek Versailles, conceited as a bride,\r\nWith garish memories of kins strewn round;\r\nOr lay your spirit's cheek on Forum ground,\r\nFor here a mighty Caesar lived and died:\r\nTo these and other stones, O ye who speed,\r\nSince there, forsooth, a prince was passing great,\r\nMore zealous let your heart's adoring heed\r\nThe Child most Royal in a crib's estate.\r\nNo poor so poor, no king more king than He:\r\nCome, better pilgrims, to this mystery.",
          "All fly - yet who is misanthrope? - \r\nThe actual men and things that pass\r\nJostling, to wither as the grass\r\nSo soon: and (be it heaven's hope,\r\nOr poetry's kaleidoscope,\r\nOr love or wine, at feast, at mass)\r\nEach owns a paradise of glass\r\nWhere never a yearning heliotrope\r\nPursues the sun's ascent or slope;\r\nFor the sun dreams there, and no time is or was.\n\r\nLike fauns embossed in our domain,\r\nWe look abroad, and our calm eyes\r\nMark how the goatish gods of pain\r\nRevel; and if by grim surprise\r\nThey break into our paradise,\r\nPatient we build its beauty up again.",
          "'Tis fine to play\r\nIn the fragrant hay,\r\nAnd romp on the golden load;\r\nTo ride old Jack\r\nTo the barn and back,\r\nOr tramp by a shady road.\r\nTo pause and drink,\r\nAt a mossy brink;\r\nAh, that is the best of joy,\r\nAnd so I say\r\nOn a summer's day,\r\nWhat's so fine as being a boy?\r\nHa, Ha!\n\r\nWith line and hook\r\nBy a babbling brook,\r\nThe fisherman's sport we ply;\r\nAnd list the song\r\nOf the feathered throng\r\nThat flit in the branches nigh.\r\nAt last we strip\r\nFor a quiet dip;\r\nAh, that is the best of joy.\r\nFor this I say\r\nOn a summer's day,\r\nWhat's so fine as being a boy?\r\nHa, Ha!",
          "My Lady clad herself in grey,\r\nThat caught and clung about her throat;\r\nThen all the long grey winter day\r\nOn me a living splendour smote;\r\nAnd why grey palmers holy are,\r\nAnd why grey minsters great in story,\r\nAnd grey skies ring the morning star,\r\nAnd grey hairs are a crown of glory.\n\r\nMy Lady clad herself in green,\r\nLike meadows where the wind-waves pass;\r\nThen round my spirit spread, I ween,\r\nA splendour of forgotten grass.\r\nThen all that dropped of stem or sod,\r\nHoarded as emeralds might be,\r\nI bowed to every bush, and trod\r\nAmid the live grass fearfully.\n\r\nMy Lady clad herself in blue,\r\nThen on me, like the seer long gone,\r\nThe likeness of a sapphire grew,\r\nThe throne of him that sat thereon.\r\nThen knew I why the Fashioner\r\nSplashed reckless blue on sky and sea;\r\nAnd ere 'twas good enough for her,\r\nHe tried it on Eternity.\n\r\nBeneath the gnarled old Knowledge-tree\r\nSat, like an owl, the evil sage:\r\n'The World's a bubble,' solemnly\r\nHe read, and turned a second page.\r\n'A bubble, then, old crow,' I cried,\r\n'God keep you in your weary wit!\r\n'A bubble--have you ever spied\r\n'The colours I have seen on it?'",

          "Once on a time, long years ago\r\n(Just when I quite forget),\r\nTwo maidens lived beside the Po,\r\nOne blonde and one brunette.\r\nThe blonde one's character was mild,\r\nFrom morning until night she smiled,\r\nWhereas the one whose hair was brown\r\nDid little else than pine and frown.\r\n(I think one ought to draw the line\r\nAt girls who always frown and pine!)\n\r\nThe blonde one learned to play the harp,\r\nLike all accomplished dames,\r\nAnd trained her voice to take C sharp\r\nAs well as Emma Eames;\r\nMade baskets out of scented grass,\r\nAnd paper-weights of hammered brass,\r\nAnd lots of other odds and ends\r\nFor gentleman and lady friends.\r\n(I think it takes a deal of sense\r\nTo manufacture gifts for gents!)\n\r\nThe dark one wore an air of gloom,\r\nProclaimed the world a bore,\r\nAnd took her breakfast in her room\r\nThree mornings out of four.\r\nWith crankiness she seemed imbued,\r\nAnd everything she said was rude:\r\nShe sniffed, and sneered, and, what is more,\r\nWhen very much provoked, she swore!\r\n(I think that I could never care\r\nFor any girl who'd learned to swear!)\n\r\nOne day the blonde was striding past\r\nA forest, all alone,\r\nWhen all at once her eyes she cast\r\nUpon a wrinkled crone,\r\nWho tottered near with shaking knees,\r\nAnd said: \"A penny, if you please!\"\r\nAnd you will learn with some surprise\r\nThis was a fairy in disguise!\r\n(I think it must be hard to know\r\nA fairy who's incognito!)\n\r\nThe maiden filled her trembling palms\r\nWith coinage of the realm.\r\nThe fairy said: \"Take back your alms!\r\nMy heart they overwhelm.\r\nHenceforth at every word shall slip\r\nA pearl or ruby from your lip!\"\r\nAnd, when the girl got home that night,--\r\nShe found the fairy's words were right!\r\n(I think there are not many girls\r\nWhose words are worth their weight in pearls!)\n\r\nIt happened that the cross brunette,\r\nTen minutes later, came\r\nAlong the self-same road, and met\r\nThat bent and wrinkled dame,\r\nWho asked her humbly for a sou.\r\nThe girl replied: \"Get out with you!\"\r\nThe fairy cried: \"Each word you drop,\r\nA toad from out your mouth shall hop!\"\r\n(I think that nothing incommodes\r\nOne's speech like uninvited toads!)\n\r\nAnd so it was, the cheerful blonde\r\nLived on in joy and bliss,\r\nAnd grew pecunious, beyond\r\nThe dreams of avarice!\r\nAnd to a nice young man was wed,\r\nAnd I have often heard it said\r\nNo other man who ever walked\r\nMost loved his wife when most she talked!\r\n(I think this very fact, forsooth,\r\nGoes far to prove I tell the truth!)\n\r\nThe cross brunette the fairy's joke\r\nBy hook or crook survived,\r\nBut still at every word she spoke\r\nAn ugly toad arrived,\r\nUntil at last she had to come\r\nTo feigning she was wholly dumb,\r\nWhereat the suitors swarmed around,\r\nAnd soon a wealthy mate she found.\r\n(I think nobody ever knew\r\nThe happier husband of the two!)\n\n\r\nThe Moral of the tale is: Bah!\r\nNous avons chang' tout cel'.\r\nNo clear idea I hope to strike\r\nOf what your nicest girl is like,\r\nBut she whose best young man I am\r\nIs not an oyster, nor a clam!",
          "Time does not bring relief; you all have lied\r\nWho told me time would ease me of my pain!\r\nI miss him in the weeping of the rain;\r\nI want him at the shrinking of the tide;\r\nThe old snows melt from every mountain-side,\r\nAnd last year's leaves are smoke in every lane;\r\nBut last year's bitter loving must remain\r\nHeaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide!\n\r\nThere are a hundred places where I fear\r\nTo go,--so with his memory they brim!\r\nAnd entering with relief some quiet place\r\nWhere never fell his foot or shone his face\r\nI say, \"There is no memory of him here!\"\r\nAnd so stand stricken, so remembering him!",
          "I call my years back, I, grown old,\r\nRecall them day by day;\r\nAnd some are dressed in cloth o' gold\r\nAnd some in humble grey.\n\r\nAnd those in gold glance scornfully\r\nOr pass me unawares;\r\nBut those in grey come close to me\r\nAnd take my hands in theirs.",
          "\r\nYes, I will spend the livelong day\r\nWith Nature in this month of May;\r\nAnd sit beneath the trees, and share\r\nMy bread with birds whose homes are there;\r\nWhile cows lie down to eat, and sheep\r\nStand to their necks in grass so deep;\r\nWhile birds do sing with all their might,\r\nAs though they felt the earth in flight.\r\nThis is the hour I dreamed of, when\r\nI sat surrounded by poor men;\r\nAnd thought of how the Arab sat\r\nAlone at evening, gazing at\r\nThe stars that bubbled in clear skies;\n\r\nAnd of young dreamers, when their eyes\r\nEnjoyed methought a precious boon\r\nIn the adventures of the Moon\r\nWhose light, behind the Clouds' dark bars,\r\nSearched for her stolen flocks of stars.\r\nWhen I, hemmed in by wrecks of men,\r\nThought of some lonely cottage then,\r\nFull of sweet books; and miles of sea,\r\nWith passing ships, in front of me;\r\nAnd having, on the other hand,\r\nA flowery, green, bird-singing land.\n",
          "The wind of evening cried along the darkening trees,\r\nAlong the darkening trees, heavy with ancient pain,\r\nHeavy with ancient pain from faded centuries,\r\nFrom faded centuries....O foolish thought and vain!\n\r\nO foolish thought and vain to think the wind could know,\r\nTo think the wind could know the griefs of men who died,\r\nThe griefs of men who died and mouldered long ago:\r\n\"And mouldered long ago,\" the wind of evening cried.",
          "Hail to you, comrades, who have won,\r\nWhere the torn lines of battle run\r\nBy tattered town and ruined mead,\r\nThe honour that men give with pride\r\nTo those who, daffing death aside,\r\nHave done the valorous deed.\n\r\nAnd has the war, then, brought to birth,\r\nAs flowers that spring from western earth\r\nAt summons of the pelting rain,\r\nThe courage that can force its way,\r\nAnd hold the shadowing wings at bay,\r\nAnd smile at lingering pain?\n\r\nAnd is it true that only now\r\nLife lifts from her heroic brow\r\nThe smothering shroud of deadly peace,\r\nAnd laughs to sniff the morning air,\r\nAnd bids a thousand bonfires flare\r\nThe news of her release?\n\r\nHell's throat may swallow down its lie,\r\nFor men knew how to live and die\r\nAnd take the gifts of motley fate,\r\nBefore the fiends of fear and greed,\r\nClasping, engendered from their seed\r\nThe hissing brood of hate.\n\r\nAre they not sightless fools who crave\r\nThe sombre splendours of the grave\r\nTo prove that man is more than dust;\r\nWho dabble fingers in the side\r\nOf him who lives because he died,\r\nBelieving, when they must?",

Egypt fair once spread the Nile,\r\nAnd green-bay-tree-like proudly flourished;\r\nHer snowy sails sea-ports bedecked,\r\nAnd deeply ploughed the rolling main,\r\nOr clave the placid lakes, as does\r\nThe gentle swan, when some soft breeze\r\nThe bulrush stirs, flings its perfume\r\nUpon the rippling silver waves!\r\nFair cities dotted here and there\r\nHer vast domain. Her royal line\r\nOf Pharaohs held the sceptre gold\r\nUpon her all-emblazoned throne.\r\nNow Egypt fair is wreck and ruin.\r\nFor, as fled on the flight of years,\r\nThe unrelenting Hand of time\r\nWiped her sweet visage off the globe!\r\nNaught save the grim, grey pyramid,\r\nSublimest work of man, yet stands\r\nTo greet the rosy morn, with proud\r\nUplifted head, expanded chest - \r\nA death defiant scoff at time!\r\nYet hoary Time in his wild rage\r\nOf wreck and ruin, like Jove shall hurl\r\nHis fiery bolts upon the head\r\nOf pyramid with ire, and crush\r\nAnd raze it to its base with scorn!\n\n\r\nV\n\r\nNext Greece, the fairest nymph that trod\r\nThis belted globe upon, once shone\r\nAs shines the Morning Orb, long ere\r\nThe Dawn the rosy East has kissed;\r\nHigh reared her sacred temples in\r\nOlympia's shady groves, and built\r\nThere sacred altars to her gods.\r\nOld Zeus and Phoebus oft here sat\r\nIn council with their fellow gods.\r\nAnd Homer, fiery bard, was first\r\nTo smite the chords of nature's lyre;\r\nSweet sang he till the earth was filled\r\nWith rarest strains of rapturous song!\r\nThen art and letters blew and blushed,\r\nThe fairest flowers of ages past,\r\nWhose essence, spilled upon the breeze,\r\nIs wafted still forever on\r\nThe twin deft with the flight of years;\r\nAnd man in calm delight inhales\r\nThe fragrance of pure classic lore!\r\nBut Greece is gone! Her statues fair\r\nAre mingled with the dust; each god\r\nHas flown some fairer clime to rule,\r\nOr, subdued, walks the dark abyss.\n\n\r\nVI\n\r\nThen Rome, the gaudy Southern Queen,\r\nOn seven rugged, rock-ribbed hills\r\nSecurely built her throne. The world\r\nThen saw a mighty power rise\r\nIn splendor great, as does the sun\r\nOn some young, swift-winged morn of June.\r\nA brighter dawning seemed to break;\r\nAnother life was lived, - for through\r\nThe Roman vein there coursed a blood,\r\nA fiery burning blood of ire,\r\nThat rose and conquered all the world.\r\nGreat C'sar led her legions forth\r\nFrom victory on to victory,\r\nAnd hung her royal pennons high\r\nIn tower, palace-hall, and throne;\r\nThe Roman sceptre swayed the globe.\r\nSoft music soothed her savage ear,\r\nFine arts and sculptor were her toys,\r\nAnd glory was her \"starry crown.\"\r\nBut now we read the \"Fall of Rome,\"\r\nThe doleful lay that tells the tale\r\nOf all who thus have passed away.\n\n\r\nVII\n\r\nTo thee, fair Dame, we thus relate\r\nThe things which were but are no more;\r\nThat thou mightest know the worldly way,\r\nAnd knowing, have no timid fear\r\nTo ever stir thy peaceful breast.\r\nNo fate like theirs awaits for thee;\r\nFor Fortune's maid shall tend with care\r\nThy every nod and beck - yes, place\r\nUpon thy queenly brow a crown,\r\nThe \"starry crown\" by Freedom worn!\r\n'Tis true no flint rock ribs thy base,\r\nNo stone thy corner marks; for that\r\nWhat carest thou? For boasted pride?\r\nThy frame is of the sturdy oak,\r\nInlaid with ribs of stately pine;\r\nThe Prince and Princess twain are they\r\nOf all Columbia's giant woods.\r\nThe sylvan songsters sing thy praise\r\nFrom dawn till set of sun, and then\r\nThe nightingale, the queen of song,\r\nIn praise of thee poureth forth her lay\r\nTill every mellow silver note,\r\nFar floating in the silent trees,\r\nIs taken by an elfish choir,\r\nAnd chanted softly to the moon.\r\nThe eagle her wee eaglets tells\r\nOf thee, that they may freedom love;\r\nThen soaring full beyond the clouds,\r\nShe looks with vaunted pride on thee.\r\nSo must thy spirit fill the hearts\r\nOf all Columbia's youth, as once\r\nIt filled old \"Honest Abe,\" thy son,\r\nThy pride - the first-born of thy love.\r\nFor when each lowly lad well knows\r\nThat ever upwards he may soar,\r\nBeyond vain tyrants' galling sway\r\nTo fairer climes where Freedom reigns:\r\nThen will the shadow of thy wing\r\nFor aye to them a shelter be!",

          "I\n\r\nAs evening falls,\r\nAnd the yellow lights leap one by one\r\nAlong high walls;\r\nAnd along black streets that glisten as if with rain,\r\nThe muted city seems\r\nLike one in a restless sleep, who lies and dreams\r\nOf vague desires, and memories, and half-forgotten pain . . .\r\nAlong dark veins, like lights the quick dreams run,\r\nFlash, are extinguished, flash again,\r\nTo mingle and glow at last in the enormous brain\r\nAnd die away . . .\r\nAs evening falls,\r\nA dream dissolves these insubstantial walls, \r\nA myriad secretly gliding lights lie bare . . .\r\nThe lovers rise, the harlot combs her hair,\r\nThe dead man's face grows blue in the dizzy lamplight,\r\nThe watchman climbs the stair . . .\r\nThe bank defaulter leers at a chaos of figures,\r\nAnd runs among them, and is beaten down;\r\nThe sick man coughs and hears the chisels ringing;\r\nThe tired clown\r\nSees the enormous crowd, a million faces,\r\nMotionless in their places,\r\nReady to laugh, and seize, and crush and tear . . .\r\nThe dancer smooths her hair,\r\nLaces her golden slippers, and runs through the door\r\nTo dance once more,\r\nHearing swift music like an enchantment rise,\r\nFeeling the praise of a thousand eyes.\n\r\nAs darkness falls\r\nThe walls grow luminous and warm, the walls\r\nTremble and glow with the lives within them moving,\r\nMoving like music, secret and rich and warm.\r\nHow shall we live tonight? Where shall we turn?\r\nTo what new light or darkness yearn?\r\nA thousand winding stairs lead down before us;\r\nAnd one by one in myriads we descend\r\nBy lamplit flowered walls, long balustrades,\r\nThrough half-lit halls which reach no end.\n\n\r\nII. THE SCREEN MAIDEN\n\r\nYou read, what is it, then that you are reading?\r\nWhat music moves so silently in your mind?\r\nYour bright hand turns the page.\r\nI watch you from my window, unsuspected:\r\nYou move in an alien land, a silent age . . .\n\r\n. . . The poet, what was his name? Tokkei, Tokkei,\r\nThe poet walked alone in a cold late rain,\r\nAnd thought his grief was like the crying of sea-birds;\r\nFor his lover was dead, he never would love again.\n\r\nRain in the dreams of the mind, rain forever,\r\nRain in the sky of the heart, rain in the willows,\r\nBut then he saw this face, this face like flame,\r\nThis quiet lady, this portrait by Hiroshigi;\r\nAnd took it home with him; and with it came\n\r\nWhat unexpected changes, subtle as weather!\r\nThe dark room, cold as rain,\r\nGrew faintly fragrant, stirred with a stir of April,\r\nWarmed its corners with light again,\n\r\nAnd smoke of incense whirled about this portrait,\r\nAnd the quiet lady there,\r\nSo young, so quietly smiling, with calm hands,\r\nSeemed ready to loose her hair,\n\r\nAnd smile, and lean from the picture, or say one word,\r\nThe word already clear,\r\nWhich seemed to rise like light between her eyelids . .\r\nHe held his breath to hear,\n\r\nAnd smiled for shame, and drank a cup of wine,\r\nAnd held a candle, and searched her face\r\nThrough all the little shadows, to see what secret\r\nMight give so warm a grace . . .\n\r\nWas it the quiet mouth, restrained a little?\r\nThe eyes, half-turned aside?\r\nThe jade ring on her wrist, still almost swinging? . . .\r\nThe secret was denied,\n\r\nHe chose his favorite pen and drew these verses,\r\nAnd slept; and as he slept\r\nA dream came into his heart, his lover entered,\r\nAnd chided him, and wept.\n\r\nAnd in the morning, waking, he remembered,\r\nAnd thought the dream was strange.\r\nWhy did his darkened lover rise from the garden?\r\nHe turned, and felt a change,\n\r\nAs if a someone hidden smiled and watched him . . .\r\nYet there was only sunlight there.\r\nUntil he saw those young eyes, quietly smiling,\r\nAnd held his breath to stare,\n\r\nAnd could have sworn her cheek had turned, a little . . .\r\nHad slightly turned away . . .\r\nSunlight dozed on the floor . . . He sat and wondered,\r\nNor left his room that day.\n\r\nAnd that day, and for many days thereafter,\r\nHe sat alone, and thought\r\nNo lady had ever lived so beautiful\r\nAs Hiroshigi wrought . . .\n\r\nOr if she lived, no matter in what country,\r\nBy what far river or hill or lonely sea,\r\nHe would look in every face until he found her . . .\r\nThere was no other as fair as she.\n\r\nAnd before her quiet face he burned soft incense,\r\nAnd brought her every day\r\nBoughs of the peach, or almond, or snow-white cherry,\r\nAnd somehow, she seemed to say,\n\r\nThat silent lady, young, and quietly smiling,\r\nThat she was happy there;\r\nAnd sometimes, seeing this, he started to tremble,\r\nAnd desired to touch her hair,\n\r\nTo lay his palm along her hand, touch faintly\r\nWith delicate finger-tips\r\nThe ghostly smile that seemed to hover and vanish\r\nUpon her lips . . .\n\r\nUntil he knew he loved this quiet lady;\r\nAnd night by night a dread\r\nLeered at his dreams, for he knew that Hiroshigi\r\nWas many centuries dead, \n\r\nAnd the lady, too, was dead, and all who knew her . .\r\nDead, and long turned to dust . . .\r\nThe thin moon waxed and waned, and left him paler,\r\nThe peach leaves flew in a gust,\n\r\nAnd he would surely have died; but there one day\r\nA wise man, white with age,\r\nStared at the portrait, and said, 'This Hiroshigi\r\nKnew more than archimage, \n\r\nCunningly drew the body, and called the spirit,\r\nTill partly it entered there . . .\r\nSometimes, at death, it entered the portrait wholly . .\r\nDo all I say with care,\n\r\nAnd she you love may come to you when you call her . . . '\r\nSo then this ghost, Tokkei,\r\nRan in the sun, bought wine of a hundred merchants,\r\nAnd alone at the end of day\n\r\nEntered the darkening room, and faced the portrait,\r\nAnd saw the quiet eyes\r\nGleaming and young in the dusk, and held the wine-cup,\r\nAnd knelt, and did not rise,\n\r\nAnd said, aloud, 'Lo-san, will you drink this wine?'\r\nSaid it three times aloud.\r\nAnd at the third the faint blue smoke of incense\r\nRose to the walls in a cloud,\n\r\nAnd the lips moved faintly, and the eyes, and the calm hands stirred;\r\nAnd suddenly, with a sigh,\r\nThe quiet lady came slowly down from the portrait,\r\nAnd stood, while worlds went by,\n\r\nAnd lifted her young white hands and took the wine cup;\r\nAnd the poet trembled, and said,\r\n'Lo-san, will you stay forever?' 'Yes, I will stay.' \r\n'But what when I am dead?'\n\r\n'When you are dead your spirit will find my spirit,\r\nAnd then we shall die no more.'\r\nMusic came down upon them, and spring returning,\r\nThey remembered worlds before,\n\r\nAnd years went over the earth, and over the sea,\r\nAnd lovers were born and spoke and died,\r\nBut forever in sunlight went these two immortal,\r\nTokkei and the quiet bride . . .\n\n\r\nIII. HAUNTED CHAMBERS\n\r\nThe lamplit page is turned, the dream forgotten;\r\nThe music changes tone, you wake, remember\r\nDeep worlds you lived before, deep worlds hereafter\r\nOf leaf on falling leaf, music on music,\r\nRain and sorrow and wind and dust and laughter.\n\r\nHelen was late and Miriam came too soon.\r\nJoseph was dead, his wife and children starving.\r\nElaine was married and soon to have a child.\r\nYou dreamed last night of fiddler-crabs with fiddles;\r\nThey played a buzzing melody, and you smiled.\n\r\nTo-morrow, what? And what of yesterday?\r\nThrough soundless labyrinths of dream you pass,\r\nThrough many doors to the one door of all.\r\nSoon as it's opened we shall hear a music:\r\nOr see a skeleton fall . . .\n\r\nWe walk with you. Where is it that you lead us?\r\nWe climb the muffled stairs beneath high lanterns.\r\nWe descend again. We grope through darkened cells.\r\nYou say: this darkness, here, will slowly kill me.\r\nIt creeps and weighs upon me . . . Is full of bells.\n\r\nThis is the thing remembered I would forget,\r\nNo matter where I go, how soft I tread,\r\nThis windy gesture menaces me with death.\r\nFatigue! it says, and points its finger at me;\r\nTouches my throat and stops my breath.\n\r\nMy fans, my jewels, the portrait of my husband,\r\nThe torn certificate for my daughter's grave,\r\nThese are but mortal seconds in immortal time.\r\nThey brush me, fade away: like drops of water.\r\nThey signify no crime.\n\r\nLet us retrace our steps: I have deceived you:\r\nNothing is here I could not frankly tell you:\r\nNo hint of guilt, or faithlessness, or threat.\r\nDreams, they are madness. Staring eyes, illusion.\r\nLet us return, hear music, and forget . . .\n\n\r\nIV. ILLICIT\n\r\nOf what she said to me that night, no matter.\r\nThe strange thing came next day.\r\nMy brain was full of music, something she played me;\r\nI couldn't remember it all, but phrases of it\r\nWreathed and wreathed among faint memories,\r\nSeeking for something, trying to tell me something,\r\nUrging to restlessness: verging on grief.\r\nI tried to play the tune, from memory, \r\nBut memory failed: the chords and discords climbed\r\nAnd found no resolution, only hung there,\r\nAnd left me morbid . . . Where, then, had I heard it? . . .\r\nWhat secret dusty chamber was it hinting?\r\n'Dust', it said, 'dust . . . and dust . . . and sunlight . .\r\nA cold clear April evening . . . snow, bedraggled,\r\nRain-worn snow, dappling the hideous grass . . .\r\nAnd someone walking alone; and someone saying\r\nThat all must end, for the time had come to go . . . '\r\nThese were the phrases . . . but behind, beneath them\r\nA greater shadow moved: and in this shadow\r\nI stood and guessed . . . Was it the blue-eyed lady?\r\nThe one who always danced in golden slippers,\r\nAnd had I danced with her, upon this music?\r\nOr was it further back, the unplumbed twilight\r\nOf childhood? No, much recenter than that.\n\r\nYou know, without my telling you, how sometimes\r\nA word or name eludes you, and you seek it\r\nThrough running ghosts of shadow, leaping at it,\r\nLying in wait for it to spring upon it,\r\nSpreading faint snares for it of sense or sound:\r\nUntil, of a sudden, as if in a phantom forest,\r\nYou hear it, see it flash among the branches,\r\nAnd scarcely knowing how, suddenly have it,\r\nWell, it was so I followed down this music,\r\nGlimpsing a face in darkness, hearing a cry,\r\nRemembering days forgotten, moods exhausted,\r\nCorners in sunlight, puddles reflecting stars;\r\nUntil, of a sudden, and least of all suspected,\r\nThe thing resolved itself: and I remembered\r\nAn April afternoon, eight years ago,\r\nOr was it nine? no matter, call it nine,\r\nA room in which the last of sunlight faded;\r\nA vase of violets, fragrance in white curtains;\r\nAnd, she who played the same thing later, playing.\n\r\nShe played this tune. And in the middle of it\r\nAbruptly broke it off, letting her hands\r\nFall in her lap. She sat there so a moment,\r\nWith shoulders drooped, then lifted up a rose,\r\nOne great white rose, wide opened like a lotos,\r\nAnd pressed it to her cheek, and closed her eyes.\n\r\n'You know, we've got to end this, Miriam loves you . . .\r\nIf she should ever know, or even guess it, \r\nWhat would she do? Listen! I'm not absurd . . .\r\nI'm sure of it. If you had eyes, for women,\r\nTo understand them, which you've never had, \r\nYou'd know it too . . . ' So went this colloquy,\r\nHalf humorous, with undertones of pathos,\r\nHalf grave, half flippant . . . while her fingers, softly,\r\nFelt for this tune, played it and let it fall,\r\nNow note by singing note, now chord by chord,\r\nRepeating phrases with a kind of pleasure . . .\r\nWas it symbolic of the woman's weakness\r\nThat she could neither break it, nor conclude?\r\nIt paused . . . and wandered . . . paused again; while she,\r\nPerplexed and tired, half told me I must go, \r\nHalf asked me if I thought I ought to go . . .\n\r\nWell, April passed with many other evenings,\r\nEvenings like this, with later suns and warmer,\r\nWith violets always there, and fragrant curtains . . .\r\nAnd she was right: and Miriam found it out . . .\r\nAnd after that, when eight deep years had passed,\r\nOr nine, we met once more, by accident . . .\r\nBut was it just by accident, I wonder,\r\nShe played this tune? Or what, then, was intended? . . .\n\n\r\nV. MELODY IN A RESTAURANT\n\r\nThe cigarette-smoke loops and slides above us,\r\nDipping and swirling as the waiter passes;\r\nYou strike a match and stare upon the flame.\r\nThe tiny fire leaps in your eyes a moment,\r\nAnd dwindles away as silently as it came.\n\r\nThis melody, you say, has certain voices,\r\nThey rise like nereids from a river, singing,\r\nLift white faces, and dive to darkness again.\r\nWherever you go you bear this river with you:\r\nA leaf falls, and it flows, and you have pain.\n\r\nSo says the tune to you, but what to me?\r\nWhat to the waiter, as he pours your coffee,\r\nThe violinist who suavely draws his bow?\r\nThat man, who folds his paper, overhears it.\r\nA thousand dreams revolve and fall and flow.\n\r\nSome one there is who sees a virgin stepping\r\nDown marble stairs to a deep tomb of roses:\r\nAt the last moment she lifts remembering eyes.\r\nGreen leaves blow down. The place is checked with shadows.\r\nA long-drawn murmur of rain goes down the skies.\r\nAnd oaks are stripped and bare, and smoke with lightning:\r\nAnd clouds are blown and torn upon high forests,\r\nAnd the great sea shakes its walls.\r\nAnd then falls silence . . . And through long silence falls\r\nThis melody once more:\r\n'Down endless stairs she goes, as once before.'\n\r\nSo says the tune to him, but what to me?\r\nWhat are the worlds I see?\r\nWhat shapes fantastic, terrible dreams? . . .\r\nI go my secret way, down secret alleys;\r\nMy errand is not so simple as it seems.\n\n\r\nVI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD\n\r\nThis is the house. On one side there is darkness,\r\nOn one side there is light.\r\nInto the darkness you may lift your lanterns,\r\nO, any number, it will still be night.\r\nAnd here are echoing stairs to lead you downward\r\nTo long sonorous halls.\r\nAnd here is spring forever at these windows,\r\nWith roses on the walls.\n\r\nThis is her room. On one side there is music,\r\nOn one side not a sound.\r\nAt one step she could move from love to silence,\r\nFeel myriad darkness coiling round.\r\nAnd here are balconies from which she heard you,\r\nYour steady footsteps on the stair.\r\nAnd here the glass in which she saw your shadow\r\nAs she unbound her hair.\n\r\nHere is the room, with ghostly walls dissolving,\r\nThe twilight room in which she called you 'lover';\r\nAnd the floorless room in which she called you 'friend.'\r\nSo many times, in doubt, she ran between them! \r\nThrough windy corridors of darkening end.\n\r\nHere she could stand with one dim light above her\r\nAnd hear far music, like a sea in caverns,\r\nMurmur away at hollowed walls of stone.\r\nAnd here, in a roofless room where it was raining,\r\nShe bore the patient sorrow of rain alone.\n\r\nYour words were walls which suddenly froze around her.\r\nYour words were windows, large enough for moonlight,\r\nToo small to let her through.\r\nYour letters, fragrant cloisters faint with music.\r\nThe music that assuaged her there was you.\n\r\nHow many times she heard your step ascending\r\nYet never saw your face!\r\nShe heard them turn again, ring slowly fainter,\r\nTill silence swept the place.\r\nWhy had you gone? . . . The door, perhaps, mistaken . . .\r\nYou would go elsewhere. The deep walls were shaken.\n\r\nA certain rose-leaf, sent without intention,\r\nBecame, with time, a woven web of fire,\r\nShe wore it, and was warm.\r\nA certain hurried glance, let fall at parting,\r\nBecame, with time, the flashings of a storm.\n\r\nYet, there was nothing asked, no hint to tell you\r\nOf secret idols carved in secret chambers\r\nFrom all you did and said.\r\nNothing was done, until at last she knew you.\r\nNothing was known, till, somehow, she was dead.\n\r\nHow did she die? You say, she died of poison.\r\nSimple and swift. And much to be regretted.\r\nYou did not see her pass\r\nSo many thousand times from light to darkness,\r\nPausing so many times before her glass;\n\r\nYou did not see how many times she hurried\r\nTo lean from certain windows, vainly hoping,\r\nPassionate still for beauty, remembered spring.\r\nYou did not know how long she clung to music,\r\nYou did not hear her sing.\n\r\nDid she, then, make the choice, and step out bravely\r\nFrom sound to silence, close, herself, those windows?\r\nOr was it true, instead,\r\nThat darkness moved, for once, and so possessed her? . . .\r\nWe'll never know, you say, for she is dead.\n\n\r\nVII. PORCELAIN\n\r\nYou see that porcelain ranged there in the window,\r\nPlatters and soup-plates done with pale pink rosebuds,\r\nAnd tiny violets, and wreaths of ivy?\r\nSee how the pattern clings to the gleaming edges!\r\nThey're works of art, minutely seen and felt,\r\nEach petal done devoutly. Is it failure\r\nTo spend your blood like this?\n\r\nStudy them . . . you will see there, in the porcelain,\r\nIf you stare hard enough, a sort of swimming\r\nOf lights and shadows, ghosts within a crystal,\r\nMy brain unfolding! There you'll see me sitting\r\nDay after day, close to a certain window,\r\nLooking down, sometimes, to see the people . . .\n\r\nSometimes my wife comes there to speak to me . . .\r\nSometimes the grey cat waves his tail around me . . .\r\nGoldfish swim in a bowl, glisten in sunlight,\r\nDilate to a gorgeous size, blow delicate bubbles,\r\nDrowse among dark green weeds. On rainy days,\r\nYou'll see a gas-light shedding light behind me,\r\nAn eye-shade round my forehead. There I sit,\r\nTwirling the tiny brushes in my paint-cups,\r\nPainting the pale pink rosebuds, minute violets,\r\nExquisite wreaths of dark green ivy leaves.\r\nOn this leaf, goes a dream I dreamed last night\r\nOf two soft-patterned toads, I thought them stones,\r\nUntil they hopped! And then a great black spider, \r\nTarantula, perhaps, a hideous thing, \r\nIt crossed the room in one tremendous leap.\r\nHere, as I coil the stems between two leaves, \r\nIt is as if, dwindling to atomy size,\r\nI cried the secret between two universes . . .\r\nA friend of mine took hasheesh once, and said\r\nJust as he fell asleep he had a dream, \r\nThough with his eyes wide open, \r\nAnd felt, or saw, or knew himself a part\r\nOf marvelous slowly-wreathing intricate patterns,\r\nPlane upon plane, depth upon coiling depth,\r\nAmazing leaves, folding one on another,\r\nVoluted grasses, twists and curves and spirals,\r\nAll of it darkly moving . . . as for me,\r\nI need no hasheesh for it, it's too easy!\r\nSoon as I shut my eyes I set out walking\r\nIn a monstrous jungle of monstrous pale pink roseleaves,\r\nViolets purple as death, dripping with water,\r\nAnd ivy-leaves as big as clouds above me.\n\r\nHere, in a simple pattern of separate violets,\r\nWith scalloped edges gilded, here you have me\r\nThinking of something else. My wife, you know,\r\nThere's something lacking, force, or will, or passion,\r\nI don't know what it is, and so, sometimes,\r\nWhen I am tired, or haven't slept three nights,\r\nOr it is cloudy, with low threat of rain,\r\nI get uneasy, just like poplar trees\r\nRuffling their leaves, and I begin to think\r\nOf poor Pauline, so many years ago,\r\nAnd that delicious night. Where is she now?\r\nI meant to write, but she has moved, by this time,\r\nAnd then, besides, she might find out I'm married.\r\nWell, there is more, I'm getting old and timid,\r\nThe years have gnawed my will. I've lost my nerve!\r\nI never strike out boldly as I used to,\r\nBut sit here, painting violets, and remember\r\nThat thrilling night. Photographers, she said,\r\nAsked her to pose for them; her eyes and forehead, \r\nDark brown eyes, and a smooth and pallid forehead, \r\nWere thought so beautiful. And so they were.\r\nPauline . . . These violets are like words remembered . . .\r\nDarling! she whispered . . . Darling! . . . Darling! . . . Darling!\r\nWell, I suppose such days can come but once.\r\nLord, how happy we were! . . .\n\r\nHere, if you only knew it, is a story,\r\nHere, in these leaves. I stopped my work to tell it,\r\nAnd then, when I had finished, went on thinking:\r\nA man I saw on a train . . . I was still a boy . . .\r\nWho killed himself by diving against a wall.\r\nHere is a recollection of my wife,\r\nWhen she was still my sweetheart, years ago.\r\nIt's funny how things change, just change, by growing,\r\nWithout an effort . . . And here are trivial things, \r\nA chill, an errand forgotten, a cut while shaving;\r\nA friend of mine who tells me he is married . . .\r\nOr is that last so trivial? Well, no matter!\n\r\nThis is the sort of thing you'll see of me,\r\nIf you look hard enough. This, in its way,\r\nIs a kind of fame. My life arranged before you\r\nIn scrolls of leaves, rosebuds, violets, ivy,\r\nClustered or wreathed on plate and cup and platter . . .\r\nSometimes, I say, I'm just like John the Baptist,\r\nYou have my head before you . . . on a platter.\n\n\r\nVIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE\n\r\nWind blows. Snow falls. The great clock in its tower\r\nTicks with reverberant coil and tolls the hour:\r\nAt the deep sudden stroke the pigeons fly . . .\r\nThe fine snow flutes the cracks between the flagstones.\r\nWe close our coats, and hurry, and search the sky.\n\r\nWe are like music, each voice of it pursuing\r\nA golden separate dream, remote, persistent,\r\nClimbing to fire, receding to hoarse despair.\r\nWhat do you whisper, brother? What do you tell me? . . .\r\nWe pass each other, are lost, and do not care.\n\r\nOne mounts up to beauty, serenely singing,\r\nForgetful of the steps that cry behind him;\r\nOne drifts slowly down from a waking dream.\r\nOne, foreseeing, lingers forever unmoving . . .\r\nUpward and downward, past him there, we stream.\n\r\nOne has death in his eyes: and walks more slowly.\r\nDeath, among jonquils, told him a freezing secret.\r\nA cloud blows over his eyes, he ponders earth.\r\nHe sees in the world a forest of sunlit jonquils:\r\nA slow black poison huddles beneath that mirth.\n\r\nDeath, from street to alley, from door to window,\r\nCries out his news, of unplumbed worlds approaching,\r\nOf a cloud of darkness soon to destroy the tower.\r\nBut why comes death, he asks, in a world so perfect?\r\nOr why the minute's grey in the golden hour?\n\r\nMusic, a sudden glissando, sinister, troubled,\r\nA drift of wind-torn petals, before him passes\r\nDown jangled streets, and dies.\r\nThe bodies of old and young, of maimed and lovely,\r\nAre slowly borne to earth, with a dirge of cries.\n\r\nDown cobbled streets they come; down huddled stairways;\r\nThrough silent halls; through carven golden doorways;\r\nFrom freezing rooms as bare as rock.\r\nThe curtains are closed across deserted windows.\r\nEarth streams out of the shovel; the pebbles knock.\n\r\nMary, whose hands rejoiced to move in sunlight;\r\nSilent Elaine; grave Anne, who sang so clearly;\r\nFugitive Helen, who loved and walked alone;\r\nMiriam too soon dead, darkly remembered;\r\nChildless Ruth, who sorrowed, but could not atone;\n\r\nJean, whose laughter flashed over depths of terror,\r\nAnd Eloise, who desired to love but dared not;\r\nDoris, who turned alone to the dark and cried, \r\nThey are blown away like windflung chords of music,\r\nThey drift away; the sudden music has died.\n\r\nAnd one, with death in his eyes, comes walking slowly\r\nAnd sees the shadow of death in many faces,\r\nAnd thinks the world is strange.\r\nHe desires immortal music and spring forever,\r\nAnd beauty that knows no change.\n\n\r\nIX. CABARET\n\r\nWe sit together and talk, or smoke in silence.\r\nYou say (but use no words) 'this night is passing\r\nAs other nights when we are dead will pass . . .'\r\nPerhaps I misconstrue you: you mean only,\r\n'How deathly pale my face looks in that glass . . .'\n\r\nYou say: 'We sit and talk, of things important . . .\r\nHow many others like ourselves, this instant,\r\nMark the pendulum swinging against the wall?\r\nHow many others, laughing, sip their coffee,\r\nOr stare at mirrors, and do not talk at all? . . .\n\r\n'This is the moment' (so you would say, in silence)\r\nWhen suddenly we have had too much of laughter:\r\nAnd a freezing stillness falls, no word to say.\r\nOur mouths feel foolish . . . For all the days hereafter\r\nWhat have we saved, what news, what tune, what play?\n\r\n'We see each other as vain and futile tricksters, \r\nPosturing like bald apes before a mirror;\r\nNo pity dims our eyes . . .\r\nHow many others, like ourselves, this instant,\r\nSee how the great world wizens, and are wise? . . .'\n\r\nWell, you are right . . . No doubt, they fall, these seconds . . .\r\nWhen suddenly all's distempered, vacuous, ugly,\r\nAnd even those most like angels creep for schemes.\r\nThe one you love leans forward, smiles, deceives you,\r\nOpens a door through which you see dark dreams.\n\r\nBut this is momentary . . . or else, enduring,\r\nLeads you with devious eyes through mists and poisons\r\nTo horrible chaos, or suicide, or crime . . .\r\nAnd all these others who at your conjuration\r\nGrow pale, feeling the skeleton touch of time, \n\r\nOr, laughing sadly, talk of things important,\r\nOr stare at mirrors, startled to see their faces,\r\nOr drown in the waveless vacuum of their days, \r\nSuddenly, as from sleep, awake, forgetting\r\nThis nauseous dream; take up their accustomed ways,\n\r\nExhume the ghost of a joke, renew loud laughter,\r\nForget the moles above their sweethearts' eyebrows,\r\nLean to the music, rise,\r\nAnd dance once more in a rose-festooned illusion\r\nWith kindness in their eyes . . .\n\r\nThey say (as we ourselves have said, remember)\r\n'What wizardry this slow waltz works upon us!\r\nAnd how it brings to mind forgotten things!'\r\nThey say 'How strange it is that one such evening\r\nCan wake vague memories of so many springs!'\n\r\nAnd so they go . . . In a thousand crowded places,\r\nThey sit to smile and talk, or rise to ragtime,\r\nAnd, for their pleasures, agree or disagree.\r\nWith secret symbols they play on secret passions.\r\nWith cunning eyes they see\n\r\nThe innocent word that sets remembrance trembling,\r\nThe dubious word that sets the scared heart beating . . .\r\nThe pendulum on the wall\r\nShakes down seconds . . . They laugh at time, dissembling;\r\nOr coil for a victim and do not talk at all.\n\n\r\nX. LETTER\n\r\nFrom time to time, lifting his eyes, he sees\r\nThe soft blue starlight through the one small window,\r\nThe moon above black trees, and clouds, and Venus, \r\nAnd turns to write . . . The clock, behind ticks softly.\n\r\nIt is so long, indeed, since I have written, \r\nTwo years, almost, your last is turning yellow, \r\nThat these first words I write seem cold and strange.\r\nAre you the man I knew, or have you altered?\r\nAltered, of course, just as I too have altered,\r\nAnd whether towards each other, or more apart,\r\nWe cannot say . . . I've just re-read your letter,\r\nNot through forgetfulness, but more for pleasure.\n\r\nPondering much on all you say in it\r\nOf mystic consciousness, divine conversion,\r\nThe sense of oneness with the infinite, \r\nFaith in the world, its beauty, and its purpose . . .\r\nWell, you believe one must have faith, in some sort,\r\nIf one's to talk through this dark world contented.\r\nBut is the world so dark? Or is it rather\r\nOur own brute minds, in which we hurry, trembling,\r\nThrough streets as yet unlighted? This, I think.\n\r\nYou have been always, let me say, \"romantic,\" \r\nEager for color, for beauty, soon discontented\r\nWith a world of dust and stones and flesh too ailing:\r\nEven before the question grew to problem\r\nAnd drove you bickering into metaphysics,\r\nYou met on lower planes the same great dragon,\r\nSeeking release, some fleeting satisfaction,\r\nIn strange aesthetics . . . You tried, as I remember,\r\nOne after one, strange cults, and some, too, morbid,\r\nThe cruder first, more violent sensations,\r\nGorgeously carnal things, conceived and acted\r\nWith splendid animal thirst . . . Then, by degrees, \r\nSavoring all more delicate gradations\n\r\nIn all that hue and tone may play on flesh,\r\nOr thought on brain, you passed, if I may say so,\r\nFrom red and scarlet through morbid greens to mauve.\r\nLet us regard ourselves, you used to say,\r\nAs instruments of music, whereon our lives\r\nWill play as we desire: and let us yield\r\nThese subtle bodies and subtler brains and nerves\r\nTo all experience plays . . . And so you went\r\nFrom subtle tune to subtler, each heard once,\r\nTwice or thrice at the most, tiring of each;\r\nAnd closing one by one your doors, drew in\r\nSlowly, through darkening labyrinths of feeling,\r\nTowards the central chamber . . . Which now you've reached.\n\r\nWhat, then's, the secret of this ultimate chamber,\r\nOr innermost, rather? If I see it clearly\r\nIt is the last, and cunningest, resort\r\nOf one who has found this world of dust and flesh, \r\nThis world of lamentations, death, injustice,\r\nSickness, humiliation, slow defeat,\r\nBareness, and ugliness, and iteration, \r\nToo meaningless; or, if it has a meaning,\r\nToo tiresomely insistent on one meaning:\n\r\nFutility . . . This world, I hear you saying, \r\nWith lifted chin, and arm in outflung gesture,\r\nColdly imperious, this transient world,\r\nWhat has it then to give, if not containing\r\nDeep hints of nobler worlds? We know its beauties, \r\nMomentary and trivial for the most part,\r\nPerceived through flesh, passing like flesh away, \r\nAnd know how much outweighed they are by darkness.\r\nWe are like searchers in a house of darkness,\r\nA house of dust; we creep with little lanterns,\r\nThrowing our tremulous arcs of light at random,\r\nNow here, now there, seeing a plane, an angle,\r\nAn edge, a curve, a wall, a broken stairway\r\nLeading to who knows what; but never seeing\r\nThe whole at once . . . We grope our way a little,\r\nAnd then grow tired. No matter what we touch,\r\nDust is the answer, dust: dust everywhere.\r\nIf this were all, what were the use, you ask?\r\nBut this is not: for why should we be seeking,\r\nWhy should we bring this need to seek for beauty,\r\nTo lift our minds, if there were only dust?\r\nThis is the central chamber you have come to:\r\nTurning your back to the world, until you came\r\nTo this deep room, and looked through rose-stained windows,\r\nAnd saw the hues of the world so sweetly changed.\n\r\nWell, in a measure, so only do we all.\r\nI am not sure that you can be refuted.\r\nAt the very last we all put faith in something, \r\nYou in this ghost that animates your world,\r\nThis ethical ghost, and I, you'll say, in reason, \r\nOr sensuous beauty, or in my secret self . . .\r\nThough as for that you put your faith in these,\r\nAs much as I do, and then, forsaking reason, \r\nAscending, you would say, to intuition, \r\nYou predicate this ghost of yours, as well.\r\nOf course, you might have argued, and you should have, \r\nThat no such deep appearance of design\r\nCould shape our world without entailing purpose:\r\nFor can design exist without a purpose?\r\nWithout conceiving mind? . . . We are like children\r\nWho find, upon the sands, beside a sea,\r\nStrange patterns drawn, circles, arcs, ellipses,\r\nMoulded in sand . . . Who put them there, we wonder?\n\r\nDid someone draw them here before we came?\r\nOr was it just the sea? We pore upon them,\r\nBut find no answer, only suppositions.\r\nAnd if these perfect shapes are evidence\r\nOf immanent mind, it is but circumstantial:\r\nWe never come upon him at his work,\r\nHe never troubles us. He stands aloof,\r\nWell, if he stands at all: is not concerned\r\nWith what we are or do. You, if you like,\r\nMay think he broods upon us, loves us, hates us,\r\nConceives some purpose of us. In so doing\r\nYou see, without much reason, will in law.\r\nI am content to say, 'this world is ordered,\r\nHappily so for us, by accident:\r\nWe go our ways untroubled save by laws\r\nOf natural things.' Who makes the more assumption?\n\r\nIf we were wise, which God knows we are not,\r\n(Notice I call on God!) we'd plumb this riddle\r\nNot in the world we see, but in ourselves.\r\nThese brains of ours, these delicate spinal clusters,\r\nHave limits: why not learn them, learn their cravings?\r\nWhich of the two minds, yours or mine, is sound?\r\nYours, which scorned the world that gave it freedom,\r\nUntil you managed to see that world as omen, \r\nOr mine, which likes the world, takes all for granted,\r\nSorrow as much as joy, and death as life? \r\nYou lean on dreams, and take more credit for it.\r\nI stand alone . . . Well, I take credit, too.\r\nYou find your pleasure in being at one with all things,\r\nFusing in lambent dream, rising and falling\r\nAs all things rise and fall . . . I do that too,\r\nWith reservations. I find more varied pleasure\r\nIn understanding: and so find beauty even\r\nIn this strange dream of yours you call the truth.\n\r\nWell, I have bored you. And it's growing late.\r\nFor household news, what have you heard, I wonder?\r\nYou must have heard that Paul was dead, by this time,\r\nOf spinal cancer. Nothing could be done,\r\nWe found it out too late. His death has changed me,\r\nDeflected much of me that lived as he lived,\r\nSaddened me, slowed me down. Such things will happen,\r\nLife is composed of them; and it seems wisdom\r\nTo see them clearly, meditate upon them,\r\nAnd understand what things flow out of them.\r\nOtherwise, all goes on here much as always.\r\nWhy won't you come and see us, in the spring,\r\nAnd bring old times with you? If you could see me\r\nSitting here by the window, watching Venus\r\nGo down behind my neighbor's poplar branches, \r\nJust where you used to sit, I'm sure you'd come.\r\nThis year, they say, the springtime will be early.\n\n\r\nXI. CONVERSATION: UNDERTONES\n\r\nWhat shall we talk of? Li Po? Hokusai?\r\nYou narrow your long dark eyes to fascinate me;\r\nYou smile a little. . . .Outside, the night goes by.\r\nI walk alone in a forest of ghostly trees . . .\r\nYour pale hands rest palm downwards on your knees.\n\r\n'These lines, converging, they suggest such distance!\r\nThe soul is drawn away, beyond horizons.\r\nLured out to what? One dares not think.\r\nSometimes, I glimpse these infinite perspectives\r\nIn intimate talk (with such as you) and shrink . . .\n\r\n'One feels so petty! One feels such emptiness! '\r\nYou mimic horror, let fall your lifted hand,\r\nAnd smile at me; with brooding tenderness . . .\r\nAlone on darkened waters I fall and rise;\r\nSlow waves above me break, faint waves of cries.\n\r\n'And then these colors . . . but who would dare describe them?\r\nThis faint rose-coral pink . . this green pistachio? \r\nSo insubstantial! Like the dim ghostly things\r\nTwo lovers find in love's still-twilight chambers . . .\r\nOld peacock-fans, and fragrant silks, and rings . . .\n\r\n'Rings, let us say, drawn from the hapless fingers\r\nOf some great lady, many centuries nameless, \r\nOr is that too sepulchral? dulled with dust;\r\nAnd necklaces that crumble if you touch them;\r\nAnd gold brocades that, breathed on, fall to rust.\n\r\n'No I am wrong . . . it is not these I sought for!\r\nWhy did they come to mind? You understand me \r\nYou know these strange vagaries of the brain!'\r\nI walk alone in a forest of ghostly trees;\r\nYour pale hands rest palm downwards on your knees;\r\nThese strange vagaries of yours are all too plain.\n\r\n'But why perplex ourselves with tedious problems\r\nOf art or . . . such things? . . . while we sit here, living,\r\nWith all that's in our secret hearts to say!'\r\nHearts? Your pale hand softly strokes the satin.\r\nYou play deep music, know well what you play.\r\nYou stroke the satin with thrilling of finger-tips,\r\nYou smile, with faintly perfumed lips,\r\nYou loose your thoughts like birds,\r\nBrushing our dreams with soft and shadowy words . .\r\nWe know your words are foolish, yet sit here bound\r\nIn tremulous webs of sound.\n\r\n'How beautiful is intimate talk like this!\r\nIt is as if we dissolved grey walls between us,\r\nStepped through the solid portals, become but shadows,\r\nTo hear a hidden music . . . Our own vast shadows\r\nLean to a giant size on the windy walls,\r\nOr dwindle away; we hear our soft footfalls\r\nEcho forever behind us, ghostly clear,\r\nMusic sings far off, flows suddenly near,\r\nAnd dies away like rain . . .\r\nWe walk through subterranean caves again,\r\nVaguely above us feeling\r\nA shadowy weight of frescos on the ceiling,\r\nStrange half-lit things,\r\nSoundless grotesques with writhing claws and wings . . .\r\nAnd here a beautiful face looks down upon us;\r\nAnd someone hurries before, unseen, and sings . . .\r\nHave we seen all, I wonder, in these chambers,\r\nOr is there yet some gorgeous vault, arched low,\r\nWhere sleeps an amazing beauty we do not know? . . '\n\r\nThe question falls: we walk in silence together,\r\nThinking of that deep vault and of its secret . . .\r\nThis lamp, these books, this fire\r\nAre suddenly blown away in a whistling darkness.\r\nDeep walls crash down in the whirlwind of desire.\n\n\r\nXII. WITCHES' SABBATH\n\r\nNow, when the moon slid under the cloud\r\nAnd the cold clear dark of starlight fell,\r\nHe heard in his blood the well-known bell\r\nTolling slowly in heaves of sound,\r\nSlowly beating, slowly beating,\r\nShaking its pulse on the stagnant air:\r\nSometimes it swung completely round,\r\nHorribly gasping as if for breath;\r\nFalling down with an anguished cry . . .\r\nNow the red bat, he mused, will fly;\r\nSomething is marked, this night, for death . . .\r\nAnd while he mused, along his blood\r\nFlew ghostly voices, remote and thin,\r\nThey rose in the cavern of his brain,\r\nLike ghosts they died away again;\r\nAnd hands upon his heart were laid,\r\nAnd music upon his flesh was played,\r\nUntil, as he was bidden to do,\r\nHe walked the wood he so well knew.\r\nThrough the cold dew he moved his feet,\r\nAnd heard far off, as under the earth,\r\nDiscordant music in shuddering tones,\r\nScreams of laughter, horrible mirth,\r\nClapping of hands, and thudding of drums,\r\nAnd the long-drawn wail of one in pain.\r\nTo-night, he thought, I shall die again,\r\nWe shall die again in the red-eyed fire\r\nTo meet on the edge of the wood beyond\r\nWith the placid gaze of fed desire . . .\r\nHe walked; and behind the whisper of trees,\r\nIn and out, one walked with him:\r\nShe parted the branches and peered at him,\r\nThrough lowered lids her two eyes burned,\r\nHe heard her breath, he saw her hand,\r\nWherever he turned his way, she turned:\r\nKept pace with him, now fast, now slow;\r\nMoving her white knees as he moved . . .\r\nThis is the one I have always loved;\r\nThis is the one whose bat-soul comes\r\nTo dance with me, flesh to flesh,\r\nIn the starlight dance of horns and drums . . .\n\r\nThe walls and roofs, the scarlet towers,\r\nSank down behind a rushing sky.\r\nHe heard a sweet song just begun\r\nAbruptly shatter in tones and die.\r\nIt whirled away. Cold silence fell.\r\nAnd again came tollings of a bell.\n\r\n * * * * *\n\r\nThis air is alive with witches: the white witch rides\r\nSwifter than smoke on the starlit wind.\r\nIn the clear darkness, while the moon hides,\r\nThey come like dreams, like something remembered . .\r\nLet us hurry! beloved; take my hand,\r\nForget these things that trouble your eyes,\r\nForget, forget! Our flesh is changed,\r\nLighter than smoke we wreathe and rise . . .\n\r\nThe cold air hisses between us . . . Beloved, beloved,\r\nWhat was the word you said?\r\nSomething about clear music that sang through water . . .\r\nI cannot remember. The storm-drops break on the leaves.\r\nSomething was lost in the darkness. Someone is dead.\r\nSomeone lies in the garden and grieves.\r\nLook how the branches are tossed in this air,\r\nFlinging their green to the earth!\r\nBlack clouds rush to devour the stars in the sky,\r\nThe moon stares down like a half-closed eye.\r\nThe leaves are scattered, the birds are blown,\r\nOaks crash down in the darkness,\r\nWe run from our windy shadows; we are running alone.\n\r\n * * * * *\n\r\nThe moon was darkened: across it flew\r\nThe swift grey tenebrous shape he knew,\r\nLike a thing of smoke it crossed the sky,\r\nThe witch! he said. And he heard a cry,\r\nAnd another came, and another came,\r\nAnd one, grown duskily red with blood,\r\nFloated an instant across the moon,\r\nHung like a dull fantastic flame . . .\r\nThe earth has veins: they throb to-night,\r\nThe earth swells warm beneath my feet,\r\nThe tips of the trees grow red and bright,\r\nThe leaves are swollen, I feel them beat,\r\nThey press together, they push and sigh,\r\nThey listen to hear the great bat cry,\r\nThe great red bat with the woman's face . . .\r\nHurry! he said. And pace for pace\r\nThat other, who trod the dark with him,\r\nCrushed the live leaves, reached out white hands\r\nAnd closed her eyes, the better to see\r\nThe priests with claws, the lovers with hooves,\r\nThe fire-lit rock, the sarabands.\r\nI am here! she said. The bough he broke,\r\nWas it the snapping bough that spoke?\r\nI am here! she said. The white thigh gleamed\r\nCold in starlight among dark leaves,\r\nThe head thrown backward as he had dreamed,\r\nThe shadowy red deep jasper mouth;\r\nAnd the lifted hands, and the virgin breasts,\r\nPassed beside him, and vanished away.\r\nI am here! she cried. He answered 'Stay!'\r\nAnd laughter arose, and near and far\r\nAnswering laughter rose and died . . .\r\nWho is there? in the dark? he cried.\r\nHe stood in terror, and heard a sound\r\nOf terrible hooves on the hollow ground;\r\nThey rushed, were still; a silence fell;\r\nAnd he heard deep tollings of a bell.\n\r\n * * * * *\n\r\nLook beloved! Why do you hide your face?\r\nLook, in the centre there, above the fire,\r\nThey are bearing the boy who blasphemed love!\r\nThey are playing a piercing music upon him\r\nWith a bow of living wire! . . .\r\nThe virgin harlot sings,\r\nShe leans above the beautiful anguished body,\r\nAnd draws slow music from those strings.\r\nThey dance around him, they fling red roses upon him,\r\nThey trample him with their naked feet,\r\nHis cries are lost in laughter,\r\nTheir feet grow dark with his blood, they beat and\r\n beat,\r\nThey dance upon him, until he cries no more . . .\r\nHave we not heard that cry before?\r\nSomewhere, somewhere,\r\nBeside a sea, in the green evening,\r\nBeneath green clouds, in a copper sky . . .\r\nWas it you? was it I?\r\nThey have quenched the fires, they dance in the darkness,\r\nThe satyrs have run among them to seize and tear,\r\nLook! he has caught one by the hair,\r\nShe screams and falls, he bears her away with him,\r\nAnd the night grows full of whistling wings.\r\nFar off, one voice, serene and sweet,\r\nRises and sings . . .\n\r\n'By the clear waters where once I died,\r\nIn the calm evening bright with stars. . . .'\r\nWhere have I heard these words? Was it you who sang them?\r\nIt was long ago.\r\nLet us hurry, beloved! the hard hooves trample;\r\nThe treetops tremble and glow.\n\r\n * * * * *\n\r\nIn the clear dark, on silent wings,\r\nThe red bat hovers beneath her moon;\r\nShe drops through the fragrant night, and clings\r\nFast in the shadow, with hands like claws,\r\nWith soft eyes closed and mouth that feeds,\r\nTo the young white flesh that warmly bleeds.\r\nThe maidens circle in dance, and raise\r\nFrom lifting throats, a soft-sung praise;\r\nTheir knees and breasts are white and bare,\r\nThey have hung pale roses in their hair,\r\nEach of them as she dances by\r\nPeers at the blood with a narrowed eye.\r\nSee how the red wing wraps him round,\r\nSee how the white youth struggles in vain!\r\nThe weak arms writhe in a soundless pain;\r\nHe writhes in the soft red veiny wings,\r\nBut still she whispers upon him and clings. . . .\r\nThis is the secret feast of love,\r\nLook well, look well, before it dies,\r\nSee how the red one trembles above,\r\nSee how quiet the white one lies! . . . .\n\r\nWind through the trees. . . .and a voice is heard\r\nSinging far off. The dead leaves fall. . . .\r\n'By the clear waters where once I died,\r\nIn the calm evening bright with stars,\r\nOne among numberless avatars,\r\nI wedded a mortal, a mortal bride,\r\nAnd lay on the stones and gave my flesh,\r\nAnd entered the hunger of him I loved.\r\nHow shall I ever escape this mesh\r\nOr be from my lover's body removed?'\r\nDead leaves stream through the hurrying air\r\nAnd the maenads dance with flying hair.\n\r\n * * * * *\n\r\nThe priests with hooves, the lovers with horns,\r\nRise in the starlight, one by one,\r\nThey draw their knives on the spurting throats,\r\nThey smear the column with blood of goats,\r\nThey dabble the blood on hair and lips\r\nAnd wait like stones for the moon's eclipse.\r\nThey stand like stones and stare at the sky\r\nWhere the moon leers down like a half-closed eye. . .\r\nIn the green moonlight still they stand\r\nWhile wind flows over the darkened sand\r\nAnd brood on the soft forgotten things\r\nThat filled their shadowy yesterdays. . . .\r\nWhere are the breasts, the scarlet wings? . . . .\r\nThey gaze at each other with troubled gaze. . . .\r\nAnd then, as the shadow closes the moon,\r\nShout, and strike with their hooves the ground,\r\nAnd rush through the dark, and fill the night\r\nWith a slowly dying clamor of sound.\r\nThere, where the great walls crowd the stars,\r\nThere, by the black wind-riven walls,\r\nIn a grove of twisted leafless trees. . . .\r\nWho are these pilgrims, who are these,\r\nThese three, the one of whom stands upright,\r\nWhile one lies weeping and one of them crawls?\r\nThe face that he turned was a wounded face,\r\nI heard the dripping of blood on stones. . . .\r\nHooves had trampled and torn this place,\r\nAnd the leaves were strewn with blood and bones.\r\nSometimes, I think, beneath my feet,\r\nThe warm earth stretches herself and sighs. . . .\r\nListen! I heard the slow heart beat. . . .\r\nI will lie on this grass as a lover lies\r\nAnd reach to the north and reach to the south\r\nAnd seek in the darkness for her mouth.\n\r\n * * * * *\n\r\nBeloved, beloved, where the slow waves of the wind\r\nShatter pale foam among great trees,\r\nUnder the hurrying stars, under the heaving arches,\r\nLike one whirled down under shadowy seas,\r\nI run to find you, I run and cry,\r\nWhere are you? Where are you? It is I. It is I.\r\nIt is your eyes I seek, it is your windy hair,\r\nYour starlight body that breathes in the darkness there.\r\nUnder the darkness I feel you stirring. . . .\r\nIs this you? Is this you?\r\nBats in this air go whirring. . . .\r\nAnd this soft mouth that darkly meets my mouth,\r\nIs this the soft mouth I knew?\r\nDarkness, and wind in the tortured trees;\r\nAnd the patter of dew.\n\r\n * * * * *\n\r\nDance! Dance! Dance! Dance!\r\nDance till the brain is red with speed!\r\nDance till you fall! Lift your torches!\r\nKiss your lovers until they bleed!\r\nBackward I draw your anguished hair\r\nUntil your eyes are stretched with pain;\r\nBackward I press you until you cry,\r\nYour lips grow white, I kiss you again,\r\nI will take a torch and set you afire,\r\nI will break your body and fling it away. . . .\r\nLook, you are trembling. . . .Lie still, beloved!\r\nLock your hands in my hair, and say\r\nDarling! darling! darling! darling!\r\nAll night long till the break of day.\n\r\nIs it your heart I hear beneath me. . . .\r\nOr the far tolling of that tower?\r\nThe voices are still that cried around us. . . .\r\nThe woods grow still for the sacred hour.\r\nRise, white lover! the day draws near.\r\nThe grey trees lean to the east in fear.\r\n'By the clear waters where once I died . . . .'\r\nBeloved, whose voice was this that cried?\r\n'By the clear waters that reach the sun\r\nBy the clear waves that starward run. . . .\r\nI found love's body and lost his soul,\r\nAnd crumbled in flame that should have annealed. . .\r\nHow shall I ever again be whole,\r\nBy what dark waters shall I be healed?'\n\r\nSilence. . . .the red leaves, one by one,\r\nFall. Far off, the maenads run.\n\r\nSilence. Beneath my naked feet\r\nThe veins of the red earth swell and beat.\r\nThe dead leaves sigh on the troubled air,\r\nFar off the maenads bind their hair. . . .\r\nHurry, beloved! the day comes soon.\r\nThe fire is drawn from the heart of the moon.\n\r\n * * * * *\n\r\nThe great bell cracks and falls at last.\r\nThe moon whirls out. The sky grows still.\r\nLook, how the white cloud crosses the stars\r\nAnd suddenly drops behind the hill!\r\nYour eyes are placid, you smile at me,\r\nWe sit in the room by candle-light.\r\nWe peer in each other's veins and see\r\nNo sign of the things we saw this night.\r\nOnly, a song is in your ears,\r\nA song you have heard, you think, in dream:\r\nThe song which only the demon hears,\r\nIn the dark forest where maenads scream . . .\n\r\n'By the clear waters where once I died . . .\r\nIn the calm evening bright with stars . . . '\r\nWhat do the strange words mean? you say, \r\nAnd touch my hand, and turn away.\n\n\r\nXIII.\n\r\nThe half-shut doors through which we heard that music\r\nAre softly closed. Horns mutter down to silence.\r\nThe stars whirl out, the night grows deep.\r\nDarkness settles upon us. A vague refrain\r\nDrowsily teases at the drowsy brain.\r\nIn numberless rooms we stretch ourselves and sleep.\n\r\nWhere have we been? What savage chaos of music\r\nWhirls in our dreams? We suddenly rise in darkness,\r\nOpen our eyes, cry out, and sleep once more.\r\nWe dream we are numberless sea-waves languidly foaming\r\nA warm white moonlit shore;\n\r\nOr clouds blown windily over a sky at midnight,\r\nOr chords of music scattered in hurrying darkness,\r\nOr a singing sound of rain . . .\r\nWe open our eyes and stare at the coiling darkness,\r\nAnd enter our dreams again.",

          "I\n\r\nAh, yes, 't is sweet still to remember,\r\nThough 'twere less painful to forget;\r\nFor while my heart glows like an ember,\r\nMine eyes with sorrow's drops are wet,\r\nAnd, oh, my heart is aching yet.\r\nIt is a law of mortal pain\r\nThat old wounds, long accounted well,\r\nBeneath the memory's potent spell,\r\nWill wake to life and bleed again.\n\r\nSo 't is with me; it might be better\r\nIf I should turn no look behind,--\r\nIf I could curb my heart, and fetter\r\nFrom reminiscent gaze my mind,\r\nOr let my soul go blind--go blind!\r\nBut would I do it if I could?\r\nNay! ease at such a price were spurned;\r\nFor, since my love was once returned,\r\nAll that I suffer seemeth good.\n\r\nI know, I know it is the fashion,\r\nWhen love has left some heart distressed,\r\nTo weight the air with wordful passion;\r\nBut I am glad that in my breast\r\nI ever held so dear a guest.\r\nLove does not come at every nod,\r\nOr every voice that calleth \"hasten;\"\r\nHe seeketh out some heart to chasten,\r\nAnd whips it, wailing, up to God!\n\r\nLove is no random road wayfarer\r\nWho where he may must sip his glass.\r\nLove is the King, the Purple-Wearer,\r\nWhose guard recks not of tree or grass\r\nTo blaze the way that he may pass.\r\nWhat if my heart be in the blast\r\nThat heralds his triumphant way;\r\nShall I repine, shall I not say:\r\n\"Rejoice, my heart, the King has passed!\"\n\r\nIn life, each heart holds some sad story--\r\nThe saddest ones are never told.\r\nI, too, have dreamed of fame and glory,\r\nAnd viewed the future bright with gold;\r\nBut that is as a tale long told.\r\nMine eyes have lost their youthful flash,\r\nMy cunning hand has lost its art;\r\nI am not old, but in my heart\r\nThe ember lies beneath the ash.\n\r\nI loved! Why not? My heart was youthful,\r\nMy mind was filled with healthy thought.\r\nHe doubts not whose own self is truthful,\r\nDoubt by dishonesty is taught;\r\nSo loved I boldly, fearing naught.\r\nI did not walk this lowly earth;\r\nMine was a newer, higher sphere,\r\nWhere youth was long and life was dear,\r\nAnd all save love was little worth.\n\r\nHer likeness! Would that I might limn it,\r\nAs Love did, with enduring art;\r\nNor dust of days nor death may dim it,\r\nWhere it lies graven on my heart,\r\nOf this sad fabric of my life a part.\r\nI would that I might paint her now\r\nAs I beheld her in that day,\r\nEre her first bloom had passed away,\r\nAnd left the lines upon her brow.\n\r\nA face serene that, beaming brightly,\r\nDisarmed the hot sun's glances bold.\r\nA foot that kissed the ground so lightly,\r\nHe frowned in wrath and deemed her cold,\r\nBut loved her still though he was old.\r\nA form where every maiden grace\r\nBloomed to perfection's richest flower,--\r\nThe statued pose of conscious power,\r\nLike lithe-limbed Dian's of the chase.\n\r\nBeneath a brow too fair for frowning,\r\nLike moon-lit deeps that glass the skies\r\nTill all the hosts above seem drowning,\r\nLooked forth her steadfast hazel eyes,\r\nWith gaze serene and purely wise.\r\nAnd over all, her tresses rare,\r\nWhich, when, with his desire grown weak,\r\nThe Night bent down to kiss her cheek,\r\nEntrapped and held him captive there.\n\r\nThis was Ione; a spirit finer\r\nNe'er burned to ash its house of clay;\r\nA soul instinct with fire diviner\r\nNe'er fled athwart the face of day,\r\nAnd tempted Time with earthly stay.\r\nHer loveliness was not alone\r\nOf face and form and tresses' hue:\r\nFor aye a pure, high soul shone through\r\nHer every act: this was Ione.\n\n\r\nII\n\r\n'T was in the radiant summer weather,\r\nWhen God looked, smiling, from the sky;\r\nAnd we went wand'ring much together\r\nBy wood and lane, Ione and I,\r\nAttracted by the subtle tie\r\nOf common thoughts and common tastes,\r\nOf eyes whose vision saw the same,\r\nAnd freely granted beauty's claim\r\nWhere others found but worthless wastes.\n\r\nWe paused to hear the far bells ringing\r\nAcross the distance, sweet and clear.\r\nWe listened to the wild bird's singing\r\nThe song he meant for his mate's ear,\r\nAnd deemed our chance to do so dear.\r\nWe loved to watch the warrior Sun,\r\nWith flaming shield and flaunting crest,\r\nGo striding down the gory West,\r\nWhen Day's long fight was fought and won.\n\r\nAnd life became a different story;\r\nWhere'er I looked, I saw new light.\r\nEarth's self assumed a greater glory,\r\nMine eyes were cleared to fuller sight.\r\nThen first I saw the need and might\r\nOf that fair band, the singing throng,\r\nWho, gifted with the skill divine,\r\nTake up the threads of life, spun fine,\r\nAnd weave them into soulful song.\n\r\nThey sung for me, whose passion pressing\r\nMy soul, found vent in song nor line.\r\nThey bore the burden of expressing\r\nAll that I felt, with art's design,\r\nAnd every word of theirs was mine.\r\nI read them to Ione, ofttimes,\r\nBy hill and shore, beneath fair skies,\r\nAnd she looked deeply in mine eyes,\r\nAnd knew my love spoke through their rhymes.\n\r\nHer life was like the stream that floweth,\r\nAnd mine was like the waiting sea;\r\nHer love was like the flower that bloweth,\r\nAnd mine was like the searching bee--\r\nI found her sweetness all for me.\r\nGod plied him in the mint of time,\r\nAnd coined for us a golden day,\r\nAnd rolled it ringing down life's way\r\nWith love's sweet music in its chime.\n\r\nAnd God unclasped the Book of Ages,\r\nAnd laid it open to our sight;\r\nUpon the dimness of its pages,\r\nSo long consigned to rayless night,\r\nHe shed the glory of his light.\r\nWe read them well, we read them long,\r\nAnd ever thrilling did we see\r\nThat love ruled all humanity,--\r\nThe master passion, pure and strong.\n\n\r\nIII\n\r\nTo-day my skies are bare and ashen,\r\nAnd bend on me without a beam.\r\nSince love is held the master-passion,\r\nIts loss must be the pain supreme--\r\nAnd grinning Fate has wrecked my dream.\r\nBut pardon, dear departed Guest,\r\nI will not rant, I will not rail;\r\nFor good the grain must feel the flail;\r\nThere are whom love has never blessed.\n\r\nI had and have a younger brother,\r\nOne whom I loved and love to-day\r\nAs never fond and doting mother\r\nAdored the babe who found its way\r\nFrom heavenly scenes into her day.\r\nOh, he was full of youth's new wine,--\r\nA man on life's ascending slope,\r\nFlushed with ambition, full of hope;\r\nAnd every wish of his was mine.\n\r\nA kingly youth; the way before him\r\nWas thronged with victories to be won;\r\nSo joyous, too, the heavens o'er him\r\nWere bright with an unchanging sun,--\r\nHis days with rhyme were overrun.\r\nToil had not taught him Nature's prose,\r\nTears had not dimmed his brilliant eyes,\r\nAnd sorrow had not made him wise;\r\nHis life was in the budding rose.\n\r\nI know not how I came to waken,\r\nSome instinct pricked my soul to sight;\r\nMy heart by some vague thrill was shaken,--\r\nA thrill so true and yet so slight,\r\nI hardly deemed I read aright.\r\nAs when a sleeper, ign'rant why,\r\nNot knowing what mysterious hand\r\nHas called him out of slumberland,\r\nStarts up to find some danger nigh.\n\r\nLove is a guest that comes, unbidden,\r\nBut, having come, asserts his right;\r\nHe will not be repressed nor hidden.\r\nAnd so my brother's dawning plight\r\nBecame uncovered to my sight.\r\nSome sound-mote in his passing tone\r\nCaught in the meshes of my ear;\r\nSome little glance, a shade too dear,\r\nBetrayed the love he bore Ione.\n\r\nWhat could I do? He was my brother,\r\nAnd young, and full of hope and trust;\r\nI could not, dared not try to smother\r\nHis flame, and turn his heart to dust.\r\nI knew how oft life gives a crust\r\nTo starving men who cry for bread;\r\nBut he was young, so few his days,\r\nHe had not learned the great world's ways,\r\nNor Disappointment's volumes read.\n\r\nHowever fair and rich the booty,\r\nI could not make his loss my gain.\r\nFor love is dear, but dearer duty,\r\nAnd here my way was clear and plain.\r\nI saw how I could save him pain.\r\nAnd so, with all my day grown dim,\r\nThat this loved brother's sun might shine,\r\nI joined his suit, gave over mine,\r\nAnd sought Ione, to plead for him.\n\r\nI found her in an eastern bower,\r\nWhere all day long the am'rous sun\r\nLay by to woo a timid flower.\r\nThis day his course was well-nigh run,\r\nBut still with lingering art he spun\r\nGold fancies on the shadowed wall.\r\nThe vines waved soft and green above,\r\nAnd there where one might tell his love,\r\nI told my griefs--I told her all!\n\r\nI told her all, and as she hearkened,\r\nA tear-drop fell upon her dress.\r\nWith grief her flushing brow was darkened;\r\nOne sob that she could not repress\r\nBetrayed the depths of her distress.\r\nUpon her grief my sorrow fed,\r\nAnd I was bowed with unlived years,\r\nMy heart swelled with a sea of tears,\r\nThe tears my manhood could not shed.\n\r\nThe world is Rome, and Fate is Nero,\r\nDisporting in the hour of doom.\r\nGod made us men; times make the hero--\r\nBut in that awful space of gloom\r\nI gave no thought but sorrow's room.\r\nAll--all was dim within that bower,\r\nWhat time the sun divorced the day;\r\nAnd all the shadows, glooming gray,\r\nProclaimed the sadness of the hour.\n\r\nShe could not speak--no word was needed;\r\nHer look, half strength and half despair,\r\nTold me I had not vainly pleaded,\r\nThat she would not ignore my prayer.\r\nAnd so she turned and left me there,\r\nAnd as she went, so passed my bliss;\r\nShe loved me, I could not mistake--\r\nBut for her own and my love's sake,\r\nHer womanhood could rise to this!\n\r\nMy wounded heart fled swift to cover,\r\nAnd life at times seemed very drear.\r\nMy brother proved an ardent lover--\r\nWhat had so young a man to fear?\r\nHe wed Ione within the year.\r\nNo shadow clouds her tranquil brow,\r\nMen speak her husband's name with pride,\r\nWhile she sits honored at his side--\r\nShe is--she must be happy now!\n\r\nI doubt the course I took no longer,\r\nSince those I love seem satisfied.\r\nThe bond between them will grow stronger\r\nAs they go forward side by side;\r\nThen will my pains be jusfied.\r\nTheir joy is mine, and that is best--\r\nI am not totally bereft;\r\nFor I have still the mem'ry left--\r\nLove stopped with me--a Royal Guest!",
          "From the candles and dumb shadows,\r\nAnd the house where love had died,\r\nI stole to the vast moonlight\r\nAnd the whispering life outside.\r\nBut I found no lips of comfort,\r\nNo home in the moon's light\r\n(I, little and lone and frightened\r\nIn the unfriendly night),\r\nAnd no meaning in the voices. . . .\r\nFar over the lands and through\r\nThe dark, beyond the ocean,\r\nI willed to think of YOU!\r\nFor I knew, had you been with me\r\nI'd have known the words of night,\r\nFound peace of heart, gone gladly\r\nIn comfort of that light.\n\r\nOh! the wind with soft beguiling\r\nWould have stolen my thought away;\r\nAnd the night, subtly smiling,\r\nCame by the silver way;\r\nAnd the moon came down and danced to me,\r\nAnd her robe was white and flying;\r\nAnd trees bent their heads to me\r\nMysteriously crying;\r\nAnd dead voices wept around me;\r\nAnd dead soft fingers thrilled;\r\nAnd the little gods whispered. . . .\r\n But ever\r\nDesperately I willed;\r\nTill all grew soft and far\r\nAnd silent . . .\r\n And suddenly\r\nI found you white and radiant,\r\nSleeping quietly,\r\nFar out through the tides of darkness.\r\nAnd I there in that great light\r\nWas alone no more, nor fearful;\r\nFor there, in the homely night,\r\nWas no thought else that mattered,\r\nAnd nothing else was true,\r\nBut the white fire of moonlight,\r\nAnd a white dream of you.",

          "I\n\r\nHe walked under the shadow of the Hill\r\nWhere men are fed into the fires\r\nAnd walled apart...\r\nUnarmed and alone,\r\nHe summoned his mates from the pit's mouth\r\nWhere tools rested on the floors\r\nAnd great cranes swung\r\nUnemptied, on the iron girders.\r\nAnd they, who were the Lords of the Hill,\r\nWere seized with a great fear,\r\nWhen they heard out of the silence of wheels\r\nThe answer ringing\r\nIn endless reverberations\r\nUnder the mountain...\n\r\nSo they covered up their faces\r\nAnd crept upon him as he slept...\r\nOut of eye-holes in black cloth\r\nThey looked upon him who had flung\r\nBetween them and their ancient prey\r\nThe frail barricade of his life...\r\nAnd when night - that has connived at so much - \r\nWas heavy with the unborn day,\r\nThey haled him from his bed...\n\r\nWho might know of that wild ride?\r\nOnly the bleak Hill - \r\nThe red Hill, vigilant,\r\nLike a blood-shot eye\r\nIn the black mask of night - \r\nDared watch them as they raced\r\nBy each blind-folded street\r\nGodiva might have ridden down...\r\nBut when they stopped beside the Place,\r\nI know he turned his face\r\nWistfully to the accessory night...\n\r\nAnd when he saw - against the sky,\r\nSagged like a silken net\r\nUnder its load of stars - \r\nThe black bridge poised\r\nLike a gigantic spider motionless...\r\nI know there was a silence in his heart,\r\nAs of a frozen sea,\r\nWhere some half lifted arm, mid-way\r\nWavers, and drops heavily...\n\r\nI know he waved to life,\r\nAnd that life signaled back, transcending space,\r\nTo each high-powered sense,\r\nSo that he missed no gesture of the wind\r\nDrawing the shut leaves close...\r\nSo that he saw the light on comrades' faces\r\nOf camp fires out of sight...\r\nAnd the savor of meat and bread\r\nBlew in his nostrils... and the breath\r\nOf unrailed spaces\r\nWhere shut wild clover smelled as sweet\r\nAs a virgin in her bed.\n\r\nI know he looked once at America,\r\nQuiescent, with her great flanks on the globe,\r\nAnd once at the skies whirling above him...\r\nThen all that he had spoken against\r\nAnd struck against and thrust against\r\nOver the frail barricade of his life\r\nRushed between him and the stars...\n\r\nII\n\r\nLife thunders on...\r\nOver the black bridge\r\nThe line of lighted cars\r\nCreeps like a monstrous serpent\r\nSpooring gold...\n\r\nWatchman, what of the track?\n\r\nNight... silence... stars...\r\nAll's Well!\n\r\nIII\n\r\nLight...\r\n(Breaking mists...\r\nHills gliding like hands out of a slipping hold...)\r\nLight over the pit mouths,\r\nStreaming in tenuous rays down the black gullets of the Hill...\r\n(The copper, insensate, sleeping in the buried lode.)\r\nLight...\r\nForcing the clogged windows of arsenals...\r\nProbing with long sentient fingers in the copper chips...\r\nGleaming metallic and cold\r\nIn numberless slivers of steel...\r\nLight over the trestles and the iron clips\r\nOf the black bridge - poised like a gigantic spider motionless - \r\nSweet inquisition of light, like a child's wonder...\r\nIntrusive, innocently staring light\r\nThat nothing appals...\n\r\nLight in the slow fumbling summer leaves,\r\nCooing and calling\r\nAll winged and avid things\r\nWaking the early flies, keen to the scent...\r\nGreen-jeweled iridescent flies\r\nUnerringly steering - \r\nSwarming over the blackened lips,\r\nThe young day sprays with indiscriminate gold...\n\r\nWatchman, what of the Hill?\n\r\nWheels turn;\r\nThe laden cars\r\nGo rumbling to the mill,\r\nAnd Labor walks beside the mules...\r\nAll's Well with the Hill!",

See! between us the shadows drift;\r\nThis bit of blood and tears means You - oh, let me have it, a parting gift.\r\nSacred I'll hold it, a trust divine; sacred your honour, her dark despair;\r\nNever shall it see printed line: here, by the living God I swear.\"\r\nBrown on a Bible laid his hand; Smith, great writer of stories, sighed:\r\n\"Comrade, I trust you, and understand. Keep my secret!\" And so he died.\n\r\nSmith was buried - up soared his sales; lured you his books in every store;\r\nExquisite, whimsy, heart-wrung tales; men devoured them and craved for more.\r\nSo when it slyly got about Brown had a posthumous manuscript,\r\nJones, the publisher, sought him out, into his pocket deep he dipped.\r\n\"A thousand dollars?\" Brown shook his head.\r\n\"The story is not for sale,\" he said.\n\r\nJones went away, then others came. Tempted and taunted, Brown was true.\r\nGuarded at friendship's shrine the fame of the unpublished story grew and grew.\r\nIt's a long, long lane that has no end, but some lanes end in the Potter's field;\r\nSmith to Brown had been more than friend: patron, protector, spur and shield.\r\nPoor, loving-wistful, dreamy Brown, long and lean, with a smile askew,\r\nFriendless he wandered up and down, gaunt as a wolf, as hungry too.\r\nBrown with his lilt of saucy rhyme, Brown with his tilt of tender mirth\r\nGarretless in the gloom and grime, singing his glad, mad songs of earth:\r\nSo at last with a faith divine, down and down to the Hunger-line.\n\r\nThere as he stood in a woeful plight, tears a-freeze on his sharp cheek-bones,\r\nWho should chance to behold his plight, but the publisher, the plethoric Jones;\r\nPeered at him for a little while, held out a bill: \"NOW, will you sell?\"\r\nBrown scanned it with his twisted smile: \"A thousand dollars! you go to hell!\"\n\r\nBrown enrolled in the homeless host, sleeping anywhere, anywhen;\r\nSuffered, strove, became a ghost, slave of the lamp for other men;\r\nFor What's-his-name and So-and-so in the abyss his soul he stripped,\r\nYet in his want, his worst of woe, held he fast to the manuscript.\r\nThen one day as he chewed his pen, half in hunger and half despair,\r\nCreaked the door of his garret den; Dick, his brother, was standing there.\r\nDown on the pallet bed he sank, ashen his face, his voice a wail:\r\n\"Save me, brother! I've robbed the bank; to-morrow it's ruin, capture, gaol.\r\nYet there's a chance: I could to-day pay back the money, save our name;\r\nYou have a manuscript, they say, worth a thousand - think, man! the shame. . . .\"\r\nBrown with his heart pain-pierced the while, with his stern, starved face, and his lips stone-pale,\r\nShuddered and smiled his twisted smile: \"Brother, I guess you go to gaol.\"\n\r\nWhile poor Brown in the leer of dawn wrestled with God for the sacred fire,\r\nCame there a woman weak and wan, out of the mob, the murk, the mire;\r\nFrail as a reed, a fellow ghost, weary with woe, with sorrowing;\r\nTwo pale souls in the legion lost; lo! Love bent with a tender wing,\r\nTaught them a joy so deep, so true, it seemed that the whole-world fabric shook,\r\nThrilled and dissolved in radiant dew; then Brown made him a golden book,\r\nFull of the faith that Life is good, that the earth is a dream divinely fair,\r\nLauding his gem of womanhood in many a lyric rich and rare;\r\nTook it to Jones, who shook his head: \"I will consider it,\" he said.\n\r\nWhile he considered, Brown's wife lay clutched in the tentacles of pain;\r\nThen came the doctor, grave and grey; spoke of decline, of nervous strain;\r\nHinted Egypt, the South of France - Brown with terror was tiger-gripped.\r\nWhere was the money? What the chance? Pitiful God! . . . the manuscript!\r\nA thousand dollars! his only hope! he gazed and gazed at the garret wall. . . .\r\nReached at last for the envelope, turned to his wife and told her all.\r\nTold of his friend, his promise true; told like his very heart would break:\r\n\"Oh, my dearest! what shall I do? shall I not sell it for your sake?\"\r\nGhostlike she lay, as still as doom; turned to the wall her weary head;\r\nIcy-cold in the pallid gloom, silent as death . . . at last she said:\r\n\"Do! my husband? Keep your vow! Guard his secret and let me die. . . .\r\nOh, my dear, I must tell you now - THE WOMAN HE LOVED AND WRONGED WAS I;\r\nDarling! I haven't long to live: I never told you - forgive, forgive!\"\n\r\nFor a long, long time Brown did not speak; sat bleak-browed in the wretched room;\r\nSlowly a tear stole down his cheek, and he kissed her hand in the dismal gloom.\r\nTo break his oath, to brand her shame; his well-loved friend, his worshipped wife;\r\nTo keep his vow, to save her name, yet at the cost of what? Her life!\r\nA moment's space did he hesitate, a moment of pain and dread and doubt,\r\nThen he broke the seals, and, stern as fate, unfolded the sheets and spread them out. . . .\r\nOn his knees by her side he limply sank, peering amazed - EACH PAGE WAS BLANK.\n\r\n(For oh, the supremest of our art are the stories we do not dare to tell,\r\nLocked in the silence of the heart, for the awful records of Heav'n and Hell.)\n\r\nYet those two in the silence there, seemed less weariful than before.\r\nHark! a step on the garret stair, a postman knocks at the flimsy door.\r\n\"Registered letter!\" Brown thrills with fear; opens, and reads, then bends above:\r\n\"Glorious tidings! Egypt, dear! The book is accepted - life and love.\"",
          "You ask why I am sad to-day,\r\nI have no cares, no griefs, you say?\r\nAh, yes, 't is true, I have no grief--\r\nBut--is there not the falling leaf?\n\r\nThe bare tree there is mourning left\r\nWith all of autumn's gray bereft;\r\nIt is not what has happened me,\r\nThink of the bare, dismantled tree.\n\r\nThe birds go South along the sky,\r\nI hear their lingering, long good-bye.\r\nWho goes reluctant from my breast?\r\nAnd yet--the lone and wind-swept nest.\n\r\nThe mourning, pale-flowered hearse goes by,\r\nWhy does a tear come to my eye?\r\nIs it the March rain blowing wild?\r\nI have no dead, I know no child.\n\r\nI am no widow by the bier\r\nOf him I held supremely dear.\r\nI have not seen the choicest one\r\nSink down as sinks the westering sun.\n\r\nFaith unto faith have I beheld,\r\nFor me, few solemn notes have swelled;\r\nLove bekoned me out to the dawn,\r\nAnd happily I followed on.\n\r\nAnd yet my heart goes out to them\r\nWhose sorrow is their diadem;\r\nThe falling leaf, the crying bird,\r\nThe voice to be, all lost, unheard--\n\r\nNot mine, not mine, and yet too much\r\nThe thrilling power of human touch,\r\nWhile all the world looks on and scorns\r\nI wear another's crown of thorns.\n\r\nCount me a priest who understands\r\nThe glorious pain of nail-pierced hands;\r\nCount me a comrade of the thief\r\nHot driven into late belief.\n\r\nOh, mother's tear, oh, father's sigh,\r\nOh, mourning sweetheart's last good-bye,\r\nI yet have known no mourning save\r\nBeside some brother's brother's grave.",

          "Come down from heaven to meet me when my breath\r\nChokes, and through drumming shafts of stifling death\r\nI stumble toward escape, to find the door\r\nOpening on morn where I may breathe once more\r\nClear cock-crow airs across some valley dim\r\nWith whispering trees. While dawn along the rim\r\nOf night's horizon flows in lakes of fire,\r\nCome down from heaven's bright hill, my song's desire.\n\r\nBelov'd and faithful, teach my soul to wake\r\nIn glades deep-ranked with flowers that gleam and shake\r\nAnd flock your paths with wonder. In your gaze\r\nShow me the vanquished vigil of my days.\r\nMute in that golden silence hung with green,\r\nCome down from heaven and bring me in your eyes\r\nRemembrance of all beauty that has been,\r\nAnd stillness from the pools of Paradise.",
          "Falls from her heaven the Moon, and stars sink burning\r\nInto the sea where blackness rims the sea,\r\nSilently quenched. Faint light that the waves hold\r\nIs only light remaining; yet still gleam\r\nThe sands where those now-sleeping young moon-bathers\r\nCame dripping out of the sea and from their arms\r\nShook flakes of light, dancing on the foamy edge\r\nOf quiet waves. They were all things of light\r\nTossed from the sea to dance under the Moon, \r\nHer nuns, dancing within her dying round,\r\nClear limbs and breasts silvered with Moon and waves\r\nAnd quick with windlike mood and body's joy,\r\nWithdrawn from alien vows, by wave and wind\r\nLightly absolved and lightly all forgetting.\n\r\nAn hour ago they left. Remains the gleam\r\nOf their late motion on the salt sea-meadow,\r\nAs loveliest hues linger when the sun's gone\r\nAnd float in the heavens and die in reedy pools, \r\nSo slowly, who shall say when light is gone?\n",
          "I loved illustrious cities and the crowds\r\nThat eddy through their incandescent nights.\r\nI loved remote horizons with far clouds\r\nGirdled, and fringed about with snowy heights.\r\nI loved fair women, their sweet, conscious ways\r\nOf wearing among hands that covet and plead\r\nThe rose ablossom at the rainbow's base\r\nThat bounds the world's desire and all its need.\r\nNature I worshipped, whose fecundity\r\nEmbraces every vision the most fair,\r\nOf perfect benediction. From a boy\r\nI gloated on existence. Earth to me\r\nSeemed all-sufficient and my sojourn there\r\nOne trembling opportunity for joy.",
          "He lay within a warm, soft world\r\nOf motion. Colors bloomed and fled,\r\nMaroon and turquoise, saffron, red,\r\nWave upon wave that broke and whirled\r\nTo vanish in the grey-green gloom,\r\nPerspectiveless and shadowy.\r\nA bulging world that had no walls,\r\nA flowing world, most like the sea,\r\nCompassing all infinity\r\nWithin a shapeless, ebbing room,\r\nAn endless tide that swells and falls...\r\nHe slept and woke and slept again.\r\nAs a veil drops Time dropped away;\r\nSpace grew a toy for children's play,\r\nSleep bolted fast the gates of Sense --\r\nHe lay in naked impotence;\r\nLike a drenched moth that creeps and crawls\r\nHeavily up brown, light-baked walls,\r\nTo fall in wreck, her task undone,\r\nYet somehow striving toward the sun.\r\nSo, as he slept, his hands clenched tighter,\r\nShut in the old way of the fighter,\r\nHis feet curled up to grip the ground,\r\nHis muscles tautened for a bound;\r\nAnd though he felt, and felt alone,\r\nStrange brightness stirred him to the bone,\r\nCravings to rise -- till deeper sleep\r\nBuried the hope, the call, the leap;\r\nA wind puffed out his mind's faint spark.\r\nHe was absorbed into the dark.\r\nHe woke again and felt a surge\r\nWithin him, a mysterious urge\r\nThat grew one hungry flame of passion;\r\nThe whole world altered shape and fashion.\r\nDeceived, befooled, bereft and torn,\r\nHe scourged the heavens with his scorn,\r\nLifting a bitter voice to cry\r\nAgainst the eternal treachery --\r\nTill, suddenly, he found the breast,\r\nAnd ceased, and all things were at rest,\r\nThe earth grew one warm languid sea\r\nAnd he a wave. Joy, tingling, crept\r\nThroughout him. He was quenched and slept.\n\r\nSo, while the moon made broad her ring,\r\nHe slept and cried and was a king.\r\nSo, worthily, he acted o'er\r\nThe endless miracle once more.\r\nFacing immense adventures daily,\r\nHe strove still onward, weeping, gaily,\r\nConquered or fled from them, but grew\r\nAs soil-starved, rough pine-saplings do.\r\nTill, one day, crawling seemed suspect.\r\nHe gripped the air and stood erect\r\nAnd splendid. With immortal rage\r\nHe entered on man's heritage!",
          "Through that window, all else being extinct\r\nExcept itself and me, I saw the struggle\r\nOf darkness against darkness. Within the room\r\nIt turned and turned, dived downward. Then I saw\r\nHow order might, if chaos wished, become:\r\nAnd saw the darkness crush upon itself,\r\nContracting powerfully; it was as if\r\nIt killed itself, slowly: and with much pain.\r\nPain. The scene was pain, and nothing but pain.\r\nWhat else, when chaos draws all forces inward\r\nTo shape a single leaf? . . .\n\r\nFor the leaf came\r\nAlone and shining in the empty room;\r\nAfter a while the twig shot downward from it;\r\nAnd from the twig a bough; and then the trunk,\r\nMassive and coarse; and last the one black root.\r\nThe black root cracked the walls. Boughs burst the window:\r\nThe great tree took possession.\n\r\nTree of trees!\r\nRemember (when time comes) how chaos died\r\nTo shape the shining leaf. Then turn, have courage,\r\nWrap arms and roots together, be convulsed\r\nWith grief, and bring back chaos out of shape.\r\nI will be watching then as I watch now.\r\nI will praise darkness now, but then the leaf.",
          "He wakes, who never thought to wake again,\r\nWho held the end was Death. He opens eyes\r\nSlowly, to one long livid oozing plain\r\nClosed down by the strange eyeless heavens. He lies;\r\nAnd waits; and once in timeless sick surmise\r\nThrough the dead air heaves up an unknown hand,\r\nLike a dry branch. No life is in that land,\r\nHimself not lives, but is a thing that cries;\r\nAn unmeaning point upon the mud; a speck\r\nOf moveless horror; an Immortal One\r\nCleansed of the world, sentient and dead; a fly\r\nFast-stuck in grey sweat on a corpse's neck.\n\r\nI thought when love for you died, I should die.\r\nIt's dead. Alone, most strangely, I live on.",
          "We who are lovers sit by the fire,\r\nCradled warm 'twixt thought and will,\r\nSit and drowse like sleeping dogs\r\nIn the equipoise of all desire,\r\nSit and listen to the still\r\nSmall hiss and whisper of green logs\r\nThat burn away, that burn away\r\nWith the sound of a far-off falling stream\r\nOf threaded water blown to steam,\r\nGrey ghost in the mountain world of grey.\r\nVapours blue as distance rise\r\nBetween the hissing logs that show\r\nA glimpse of rosy heat below;\r\nAnd candles watch with tireless eyes\r\nWhile we sit drowsing here. I know,\r\nDimly, that there exists a world,\r\nThat there is time perhaps, and space\r\nOther and wider than this place,\r\nWhere at the fireside drowsily curled\r\nWe hear the whisper and watch the flame\r\nBurn blinkless and inscrutable.\r\nAnd then I know those other names\r\nThat through my brain from cell to cell\r\nEcho--reverberated shout\r\nOf waiters mournful along corridors:\r\nBut nobody carries the orders out,\r\nAnd the names (dear friends, your name and yours)\r\nEvoke no sign. But here I sit\r\nOn the wide hearth, and there are you:\r\nThat is enough and only true.\r\nThe world and the friends that lived in it\r\nAre shadows: you alone remain\r\nReal in this drowsing room,\r\nFull of the whispers of distant rain\r\nAnd candles staring into the gloom.",

Its broken windows are boarded.\r\nThe bronze weathervane cod has lost half its scales.\r\nThe airy tanks are dry.\r\nOnce my nose crawled like a snail on the glass;\r\nmy hand tingled to burst the bubbles\r\ndrifting from the noses of the crowded, compliant fish.\n\r\nMy hand draws back. I often sign still\r\nfor the dark downward and vegetating kingdom\r\nof the fish and reptile. One morning last March,\r\nI pressed against the new barbed and galvanized\n\r\nfence on the Boston Common. Behind their cage,\r\nyellow dinosaur steamshovels were grunting\r\nas they cropped up tons of mush and grass\r\nto gouge their underworld garage.\n\r\nParking spaces luxuriate like civic\r\nsandpiles in the heart of Boston.\r\na girdle of orange, Puritan-pumpkin colored girders\r\nbraces the tingling Statehouse,\n\r\nshaking over the excavations, as it faces Colonel Shaw\r\nand his bell-cheeked Negro infantry\r\non St. Gaudens' shaking Civil War relief,\r\npropped by a plank splint against the garage's earthquake.\n\r\nTwo months after marching through Boston,\r\nhalf of the regiment was dead;\r\nat the dedication,\r\nWilliam James could almost hear the bronze Negroes breathe.\n\r\nTheir monument sticks like a fishbone\r\nin the city's throat.\r\nIts Colonel is a lean\r\nas a compass-needle.\n\r\nHe has an angry wrenlike vigilance,\r\na greyhound's gentle tautness;\r\nhe seems to wince at pleasure,\r\nand suffocate for privacy.\n\r\nHe is out of bounds now. He rejoices in man's lovely,\r\npeculiar power to choose life and die\r\nwhen he leads his black soldiers to death,\r\nhe cannot bend his back.\n\r\nOn a thousand small town New England greens\r\nthe old white churches hold their air\r\nof sparse, sincere rebellion; frayed flags\r\nquilt the graveyards of the Grand Army of the Republic\n\r\nThe stone statutes of the abstract Union Soldier\r\ngrow slimmer and younger each year-\r\nwasp-waisted, they doze over muskets\r\nand muse through their sideburns'\n\r\nShaw's father wanted no monument\r\nexcept the ditch,\r\nwhere his son's body was thrown\r\nand lost with his \"niggers.\"\n\r\nThe ditch is nearer.\r\nThere are no statutes for the last war here;\r\non Boylston Street, a commercial photograph\r\nshows Hiroshima boiling\n\r\nover a Mosler Safe, the \"Rock of Ages\"\r\nthat survived the blast.

          "Their strength had fed on this when Death's white arms\r\nCame sleeved in vapors and miasmal dew,\r\nCurling across the jungle's ferny floor,\r\nBecking each fevered brain. On bleak divides,\r\nWhere Sleep grew niggardly for nipping cold\r\nThat twinged blue lips into a mouthed curse,\r\nNot back to Seville and its sunny plains\r\nWinged their brief-biding dreams, but once again,\r\nLords of a palace in Tenochtitlan,\r\nThey guarded Montezuma's treasure-hoard.\r\nGold, like some finny harvest of the sea,\r\nPoured out knee deep around the rifted floors,\r\nShiny and sparkling, - arms and crowns and rings:\r\nGold, sweet to toy with as beloved hair, - \r\nTo plunge the lustful, crawling fingers down,\r\nArms elbow deep, and draw them out again,\r\nAnd watch the glinting metal trickle off,\r\nEven as at night some fisherman, home bound\r\nWith speckled cargo in his hollow keel\r\nCaught off Campeche or the Isle of Pines,\r\nDips in his paddle, lifts it forth again,\r\nAnd laughs to see the luminous white drops\r\nFall back in flakes of fire. . . . Gold was the dream\r\nThat cheered that desperate enterprise. And now? . . .\r\nVictory waited on the arms of Spain,\r\nFallen was the lovely city by the lake,\r\nThe sunny Venice of the western world;\r\nThere many corpses, rotting in the wind,\r\nPoked up stiff limbs, but in the leprous rags\r\nNo jewel caught the sun, no tawny chain\r\nGleamed, as the prying halberds raked them o'er.\r\nPillage that ran red-handed through the streets\r\nCame railing home at evening empty-palmed;\r\nAnd they, on that sad night a twelvemonth gone,\r\nWho, ounce by ounce, dear as their own life's blood\r\nRetreating, cast the cumbrous load away:\r\nThey, when brown foemen lopped the bridges down,\r\nWho tipped thonged chests into the stream below\r\nAnd over wealth that might have ransomed kings\r\nPassed on to safety; - cheated, guerdonless - \r\nFound (through their fingers the bright booty slipped)\r\nA city naked, of that golden dream\r\nShorn in one moment like a sunset sky.\n\r\nDeep in a chamber that no cheerful ray\r\nPurged of damp air, where in unbroken night\r\nBlack scorpions nested in the sooty beams,\r\nHelpless and manacled they led him down - \r\nCuauhtemotzin - and other lords beside - \r\nAll chieftains of the people, heroes all - \r\nAnd stripped their feathered robes and bound them there\r\nOn short stone settles sloping to the head,\r\nBut where the feet projected, underneath\r\nHeaped the red coals. Their swarthy fronts illumed,\r\nThe bearded Spaniards, helmed and haubergeoned,\r\nPaced up and down beneath the lurid vault.\r\nSome kneeling fanned the glowing braziers; some\r\nStood at the sufferers' heads and all the while\r\nHissed in their ears: \"The gold . . . the gold . . . the gold.\r\nWhere have ye hidden it - the chested gold?\r\nSpeak - and the torments cease!\"\n\r\nThey answered not.\r\nPast those proud lips whose key their sovereign claimed\r\nNo accent fell to chide or to betray,\r\nOnly it chanced that bound beside the king\r\nLay one whom Nature, more than other men\r\nFraming for delicate and perfumed ease,\r\nNot yet, along the happy ways of Youth,\r\nHad weaned from gentle usages so far\r\nTo teach that fortitude that warriors feel\r\nAnd glory in the proof. He answered not,\r\nBut writhing with intolerable pain,\r\nConvulsed in every limb, and all his face\r\nWrought to distortion with the agony,\r\nTurned on his lord a look of wild appeal,\r\nThe secret half atremble on his lips,\r\nLivid and quivering, that waited yet\r\nFor leave - for leave to utter it - one sign - \r\nOne word - one little word - to ease his pain.\n\r\nAs one reclining in the banquet hall,\r\nPropped on an elbow, garlanded with flowers,\r\nSaw lust and greed and boisterous revelry\r\nSurge round him on the tides of wine, but he,\r\nStaunch in the ethic of an antique school - \r\nStoic or Cynic or of Pyrrho's mind - \r\nWith steady eyes surveyed the unbridled scene,\r\nHimself impassive, silent, self-contained:\r\nSo sat the Indian prince, with brow unblanched,\r\nAmid the tortured and the torturers.\r\nHe who had seen his hopes made desolate,\r\nHis realm despoiled, his early crown deprived him,\r\nAnd watched while Pestilence and Famine piled\r\nHis stricken people in their reeking doors,\r\nWhence glassy eyes looked out and lean brown arms\r\nStretched up to greet him in one last farewell\r\nAs back and forth he paced along the streets\r\nWith words of hopeless comfort - what was this\r\nThat one should weaken now? He weakened not.\r\nWhate'er was in his heart, he neither dealt\r\nIn pity nor in scorn, but, turning round,\r\nMet that racked visage with his own unmoved,\r\nBent on the sufferer his mild calm eyes,\r\nAnd while the pangs smote sharper, in a voice,\r\nAs who would speak not all in gentleness\r\nNor all disdain, said: \"Yes! And am -I- then\r\nUpon a bed of roses?\"\n\r\nStung with shame - \r\nShame bitterer than his anguish - to betray\r\nSuch cowardice before the man he loved,\r\nAnd merit such rebuke, the boy grew calm;\r\nAnd stilled his struggling limbs and moaning cries,\r\nAnd shook away his tears, and strove to smile,\r\nAnd turned his face against the wall - and died.",

One day, somehow, someone 'picked me out'.\r\nOn that occasion there was a woman standing behind me,\r\nher lips blue with cold, who, of course, had never in\r\nher life heard my name. Jolted out of the torpor\r\ncharacteristic of all of us, she said into my ear\r\n(everyone whispered there) - 'Could one ever describe\r\nthis?' And I answered - 'I can.'

Now, however, my supper is over, my pipe alight, and as I stretch my legs before the embers I have at last a glow of comfort, a glimpse of peace.\n\n\n\n\r\nMy Garret\n\n\n\r\n Here is my Garret up five flights of stairs;\r\n Here's where I deal in dreams and ply in fancies,\r\n Here is the wonder-shop of all my wares,\r\n My sounding sonnets and my red romances.\r\n Here's where I challenge Fate and ring my rhymes,\r\n And grope at glory - aye, and starve at times.\n\r\n Here is my Stronghold: stout of heart am I,\r\n Greeting each dawn as songful as a linnet;\r\n And when at night on yon poor bed I lie\r\n (Blessing the world and every soul that's in it),\r\n Here's where I thank the Lord no shadow bars\r\n My skylight's vision of the valiant stars.\n\r\n Here is my Palace tapestried with dreams.\r\n Ah! though to-night ten sous are all my treasure,\r\n While in my gaze immortal beauty gleams,\r\n Am I not dowered with wealth beyond all measure?\r\n Though in my ragged coat my songs I sing,\r\n King of my soul, I envy not the king.\n\r\n Here is my Haven: it's so quiet here;\r\n Only the scratch of pen, the candle's flutter;\r\n Shabby and bare and small, but O how dear!\r\n Mark you - my table with my work a-clutter,\r\n My shelf of tattered books along the wall,\r\n My bed, my broken chair - that's nearly all.\n\r\n Only four faded walls, yet mine, all mine.\r\n Oh, you fine folks, a pauper scorns your pity.\r\n Look, where above me stars of rapture shine;\r\n See, where below me gleams the siren city . . .\r\n Am I not rich? - a millionaire no less,\r\n If wealth be told in terms of Happiness.",
          "Over the surging tides and the mountain kingdoms,\r\nOver the pastoral valleys and the meadows,\r\nOver the cities with their factory darkness,\r\nOver the lands where peace is still a power,\r\nOver all these and all this planet carries\r\nA power broods, invisible monarch, a stranger\r\nTo some, but by many trusted. Man's a believer\r\nUntil corrupted. This huge trusted power\r\nIs spirit. He moves in the muscle of the world,\r\nIn continual creation. He burns the tides, he shines\r\nFrom the matchless skies. He is the day's surrender.\r\nRecognize him in the eye of the angry tiger,\r\nIn the sign of a child stepping at last into sleep,\r\nIn whatever touches, graces and confesses,\r\nIn hopes fulfilled or forgotten, in promises\n\r\nKept, in the resignation of old men,\r\nThis spirit, this power, this holder together of space\r\nIs about, is aware, is working in your breathing.\r\nBut most he is the need that shows in hunger\r\nAnd in the tears shed in the lonely fastness.\r\nAnd in sorrow after anger.",
          "As the Wind, and as the Wind,\r\nIn a corner of the way,\r\nGoes stepping, stands twirling,\r\nInvisibly, comes whirling,\r\nBows before, and skips behind,\r\nIn a grave, an endless play\n\r\nSo my Heart, and so my Heart,\r\nFollowing where your feet have gone,\r\nStirs dust of old dreams there;\r\nHe turns a toe; he gleams there,\r\nTreading you a dance apart.\r\nBut you see not. You pass on.",
          "High up in the sky there, now, you know,\r\nIn this May twilight, our cottage is asleep,\r\nTenantless, and no creature there to go\r\nNear it but Mrs. Fry's fat cows, and sheep\r\nDove-coloured, as is Cotswold. No one hears\r\nUnder that cherry-tree the night-jars yet,\r\nThe windows are uncurtained; on the stairs\r\nSilence is but by tip-toe silence met.\r\nAll doors are fast there. It is a dwelling put by\r\nFrom use for a little, or long, up there in the sky.\n\r\nEmpty; a walled-in silence, in this twilight of May -\r\nHome for lovers, and friendly withdrawing, and sleep,\r\nWith none to love there, nor laugh, nor climb from the day\r\nTo the candles and linen ... Yet in the silence creep,\r\nThis minute, I know, little ghosts, little virtuous lives,\r\nBreathing upon that still, insensible place,\r\nTouching the latches, sorting the napkins and knives,\r\nAnd such for the comfort of being, and bowls for the grace,\r\nThat roses will brim; they are creeping from that room to this,\r\nOne room, and two, till the four are visited ... they,\r\nLittle ghosts, little lives, are our thoughts in this twilight of May,\r\nSigns that even the curious man would miss,\r\nOf travelling lovers to Cotswold, signs of an hour,\r\nVery soon, when up from the valley in June will ride\r\nLovers by Lynch to Oakridge up in the wide\r\nBow of the hill, to a garden of lavender flower ...\r\nThe doors are locked; no foot falls; the hearths are dumb -\r\nBut we are there - we are waiting ourselves who come.\n",
          "A man doesn't have time in his life\r\nto have time for everything.\r\nHe doesn't have seasons enough to have\r\na season for every purpose. Ecclesiastes\r\nWas wrong about that.\n\r\nA man needs to love and to hate at the same moment,\r\nto laugh and cry with the same eyes,\r\nwith the same hands to throw stones and to gather them,\r\nto make love in war and war in love.\r\nAnd to hate and forgive and remember and forget,\r\nto arrange and confuse, to eat and to digest what history\r\ntakes years and years to do.\n\r\nA man doesn't have time.\r\nWhen he loses he seeks, when he finds\r\nhe forgets, when he forgets he loves, when he loves he begins to forget.",

          "Fortunatus, a fisherman Dane,\r\nSet out on a sudden for Spain,\r\nBecause, runs the story,\r\nHe'd met with a hoary\r\nMysterious sorcerer chap,\r\nWho, trouble to save him,\r\nMost thoughtfully gave him\r\nA magical traveling cap.\r\nI barely believe that the story is true,\r\nBut here's what that cap was reported to do.\n\r\nSuppose you were sitting at home,\r\nAnd you wished to see Paris or Rome,\r\nYou'd pick up that bonnet,\r\nYou'd carefully don it,\r\nThe name of the city you'd call,\r\nAnd the very next minute\r\nBy Jove, you were in it,\r\nWithout having started at all!\r\nOne moment you sauntered on upper Broadway,\r\nAnd the next on the Corso or rue de la Paix!\n\r\nWhy, it beat every journey of Cook's,\r\nKnocked spots out of Baedeker's books!\r\nHe stepped from his doorway\r\nDirect into Norway,\r\nHe hopped in a trice to Ceylon,\r\nHe saw Madagascar,\r\nWent round by Alaska,\r\nAnd called on a girl in Luzon:\r\nIf they said she'd be down in a moment or two,\r\nHe took, while he waited, a peek at Peru!\n\r\nHe could wake up at eight in Siam,\r\nTake his tub, if he wanted, in Guam.\r\nEat breakfast in Kansas,\r\nAnd lunch in Matanzas,\r\nGo out for a walk in Brazil,\r\nTake tea in Madeira,\r\nDine on the Riviera,\r\nAnd smoke his cigar in Seville,\r\nGo out to the theatre in Vladivostok,\r\nAnd retire in New York at eleven o'clock!\n\r\nEvery tongue he could readily speak:\r\nFrench, German, Italian, Greek,\r\nNorwegian, Bulgarian,\r\nTurkish, Bavarian,\r\nJapanese, Hindustanee,\r\nRussian and Mexican!\r\nHe was a lexicon,\r\nSuch as you seldom will see.\r\nHis knowledge linguistic gave Ollendorff fits,\r\nAnd brought a hot flush to the face of Berlitz!\n\r\nHe would bow in an intimate way\r\nTo Menelik and to Loubet,\r\nHe was frequently beckoned,\r\nBy William the Second,\r\nA word of advice to receive,\r\nHe talked with bravado\r\nAbout the Mikado,\r\nKing Oscar, Oom Paul, the Khedive,\r\nKing Victor Emmanuel Second, the Shah,\r\nKing Edward the Seventh, Kwang Su, and the Czar!\n\r\nBut what did he get from it all?\r\nHis wife used to wait in the hall!\r\nWhen this wandering mortal\r\nSet foot on the portal,\r\nShe always appeared on the scene,\r\nAnd, far from ideally,\r\nRemarked: \"Well, I really\r\nWould like to know where you have been!\"\r\nNow what is the good of a wandering life,\r\nIf you have to tell all that you do to your wife?\n\r\nShe'd indulge in a copious cry,\r\nShe'd remark she'd undoubtedly die,\r\nOr, like many another,\r\nGo back to her mother,\r\nAnd what would the world think of that?\r\nShe only grew pleasant,\r\nWhen offered a present\r\nOf gloves or a gown or a hat:\r\nAnd more than his talisman saved him in fare\r\nFortunatus expended in putting things square!\n\n\r\nAnd The Moral is easily said:\r\nLike our hero, you're certain to find,\r\nWhen such a cap goes on a head,\r\nRetribution will follow behind!",

          "I don't care whether I am beautiful to you\r\nYou other women.\r\nNothing of me that you see is my own;\r\nA man balances, bone unto bone\r\nBalances, everything thrown\r\nIn the scale, you other women.\n\r\nYou may look and say to yourselves, I do\r\nNot show like the rest.\r\nMy face may not please you, nor my stature; yet if you knew\r\nHow happy I am, how my heart in the wind rings true\r\nLike a bell that is chiming, each stroke as a stroke\r\n falls due,\r\nYou other women:\n\r\nYou would draw your mirror towards you, you would wish\r\nTo be different.\r\nThere's the beauty you cannot see, myself and him\r\nBalanced in glorious equilibrium,\r\nThe swinging beauty of equilibrium,\r\nYou other women.\n\r\nThere's this other beauty, the way of the stars\r\nYou straggling women.\r\nIf you knew how I swerve in peace, in the equi- poise\r\nWith the man, if you knew how my flesh enjoys\r\nThe swinging bliss no shattering ever destroys\r\nYou other women:\n\r\nYou would envy me, you would think me wonderful\r\nBeyond compare;\r\nYou would weep to be lapsing on such harmony\r\nAs carries me, you would wonder aloud that he\r\nWho is so strange should correspond with me\r\nEverywhere.\n\r\nYou see he is different, he is dangerous,\r\nWithout pity or love.\r\nAnd yet how his separate being liberates me\r\nAnd gives me peace! You cannot see\r\nHow the stars are moving in surety\r\nExquisite, high above.\n\r\nWe move without knowing, we sleep, and we travel on,\r\nYou other women.\r\nAnd this is beauty to me, to be lifted and gone\r\nIn a motion human inhuman, two and one\r\nEncompassed, and many reduced to none,\r\nYou other women.\n\r\n KENSINGTON",
          "Oh for the breath of the briny deep,\r\nAnd the tug of the bellying sail,\r\nWith the sea-gull's cry across the sky\r\nAnd a passing boatman's hail.\r\nFor, be she fierce or be she gay,\r\nThe sea is a famous friend alway.\n\r\nHo! for the plains where the dolphins play,\r\nAnd the bend of the mast and spars,\r\nAnd a fight at night with the wild sea-sprite\r\nWhen the foam has drowned the stars.\r\nAnd, pray, what joy can the landsman feel\r\nLike the rise and fall of a sliding keel?\n\r\nFair is the mead; the lawn is fair\r\nAnd the birds sing sweet on the lea;\r\nBut the echo soft of a song aloft\r\nIs the strain that pleases me;\r\nAnd swish of rope and ring of chain\r\nAre music to men who sail the main.\n\r\nThen, if you love me, let me sail\r\nWhile a vessel dares the deep;\r\nFor the ship 's my wife, and the breath of life\r\nAre the raging gales that sweep;\r\nAnd when I 'm done with calm and blast,\r\nA slide o'er the side, and rest at last.",
          "The wind is out in its rage to-night,\r\nAnd your father is far at sea.\r\nThe rime on the window is hard and white\r\nBut dear, you are near to me.\r\nHeave ho, weave low,\r\nWaves of the briny deep;\r\nSeethe low and breathe low,\r\nBut sleep you, my little one, sleep, sleep.\n\r\nThe little boat rocks in the cove no more,\r\nBut the flying sea-gulls wail;\r\nI peer through the darkness that wraps the shore,\r\nFor sight of a home set sail.\r\nHeave ho, weave low,\r\nWaves of the briny deep;\r\nSeethe low and breathe low,\r\nBut sleep you, my little one, sleep, sleep.\n\r\nAy, lad of mine, thy father may die\r\nIn the gale that rides the sea,\r\nBut we'll not believe it, not you and I,\r\nWho mind us of Galilee.\r\nHeave ho, weave low,\r\nWaves of the briny deep;\r\nSeethe low and breathe low,\r\nBut sleep you, my little one, sleep, sleep.",
          "The moon has left the sky, love,\r\nThe stars are hiding now,\r\nAnd frowning on the world, love,\r\nNight bares her sable brow.\r\nThe snow is on the ground, love,\r\nAnd cold and keen the air is.\r\nI 'm singing here to you, love;\r\nYou 're dreaming there in Paris.\n\r\nBut this is Nature's law, love,\r\nThough just it may not seem,\r\nThat men should wake to sing, love,\r\nWhile maidens sleep and dream.\r\nThem care may not molest, love,\r\nNor stir them from their slumbers,\r\nThough midnight find the swain, love,\r\nStill halting o'er his numbers.\n\r\nI watch the rosy dawn, love,\r\nCome stealing up the east,\r\nWhile all things round rejoice, love,\r\nThat Night her reign has ceased.\r\nThe lark will soon be heard, love,\r\nAnd on his way be winging;\r\nWhen Nature's poets wake, love,\r\nWhy should a man be singing?",

          "On the banks of the Mersey, o'er on Cheshire side,\r\nLies Runcorn that's best known to fame\r\nBy Transporter Bridge as takes folks over t'stream,\r\nOr else brings them back across same.\n\r\nIn days afore Transporter Bridge were put up,\r\nA ferryboat lay in the slip,\r\nAnd old Ted the boatman would row folks across\r\nAt per tuppence per person per trip.\n\r\nNow Runcorn lay over on one side of stream,\r\nAnd Widnes on t'other side stood,\r\nAnd, as nobody wanted to go either place,\r\nWell, the trade wasn't any too good.\n\r\nOne evening, to Ted's superlative surprise,\r\nThree customers came into view:\r\nA Mr and Mrs Ramsbottom it were,\r\nAnd Albert, their little son, too.\n\r\n\"How much for the three?\" Mr Ramsbottom asked,\r\nAs his hand to his pocket did dip.\r\nTed said: \"Same for three as it would be for one,\r\nPer tuppence per person per trip.\"\n\r\n\"You're not charging tuppence for that little lad?\"\r\nSaid Mother, her eyes flashing wild.\r\n\"Per tuppence per person per trip\", answered Ted,\r\n\"Per woman, per man, or per child\".\n\r\n\"Fivepence for three, that's the most that I'll pay\",\r\nSaid Father, \"Don't waste time in talk\".\r\n\"Per tuppence per person per trip\", answered Ted,\r\n\"And them, as can't pay, 'as to walk!\"\n\r\n\"We can walk, an' all\", said Father. \"Come Mother,\r\nIt's none so deep, weather's quite mild\".\r\nSo into the water the three of them stepped:\r\nThe father, the mother, the child.\n\r\nThe further they paddled, the deeper it got,\r\nBut they wouldn't give in, once begun.\r\nIn the spirit that's made Lancashire what she is,\r\nThey'd sooner be drownded than done.\n\r\nVery soon, the old people were up to their necks,\r\nAnd the little lad clean out of sight.\r\nSaid Father: \"Where's Albert?\" And Mother replied:\r\n\"I've got hold of his hand, he's all right!\"\n\r\nWell, just at that moment, Pa got an idea\r\nAnd, floundering back to old Ted, He said:\r\n\"We've walked half-way. Come, tak' us the rest\r\nFor half-price, that's a penny a head.\"\n\r\nBut Ted wasn't standing for none of that there,\r\nAnd, making an obstinate lip,\r\n\"Per tuppence per person per trip\", Ted replied,\r\n\"Per trip, or per part of per trip\".\n\r\n\"All right, then\", said Father, \"let me tak' the boat,\r\nAnd I'll pick up the others half-way.\r\nI'll row them across, and I'll bring the boat back,\r\nAnd thruppence in t'bargain I'll pay\".\n\r\nT'were money for nothing. Ted answered: \"Right-ho\",\r\nAnd Father got hold of the sculls.\r\nWith the sharp end of boat towards middle of stream,\r\nHe were there in a couple of pulls.\n\r\nHe got Mother out, it were rather a job,\r\nWith the water, she weighed half a ton,\r\nThen, pushing the oar down the side of the boat,\r\nStarted fishing around for his son.\n\r\nWhen poor little Albert came up to the top,\r\nHis collars were soggy and limp.\r\nAnd, with holding his breath at the bottom so long,\r\nHis face were as red as a shrimp.\n\r\nPa took them across, and he brought the boat back,\r\nAnd he said to old Ted on the slip:\r\n\"Wilt' row me across by me'sen?\" Ted said:\r\n\"Aye, at per tuppence per person per trip\".\n\r\nWhen they got t'other side, Father laughed fit to bust.\r\nHe'd got best of bargain, you see.\r\nHe'd worked it all out, and he'd got his own way,\r\nAnd he'd paid nobbut fivepence for three!",

I cross the line of foam\r\nThat breaks around a town of grey and red,\r\n Whose streets and squares lie dead\r\nBeneath the silent dawn - then am I proud\r\nThat England's peace to guard I am allowed; - \r\n Then bow my humble head,\r\nIn thanks to Him Who brings me safely home.\n\r\n Luxeuil-les-Bains, 1917.",

          "A Study of the Negro Race\n\n\n\r\n I.Their Basic Savagery\n\r\n Fat black bucks in a wine-barrel room,\r\n Barrel-house kings, with feet unstable,\r\n # A deep rolling bass. #\r\n Sagged and reeled and pounded on the table,\r\n Pounded on the table,\r\n Beat an empty barrel with the handle of a broom,\r\n Hard as they were able,\r\n Boom, boom, BOOM,\r\n With a silk umbrella and the handle of a broom,\r\n Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, BOOM.\r\n THEN I had religion, THEN I had a vision.\r\n I could not turn from their revel in derision.\r\n # More deliberate.Solemnly chanted. #\r\n THEN I SAW THE CONGO, CREEPING THROUGH THE BLACK,\r\n CUTTING THROUGH THE FOREST WITH A GOLDEN TRACK.\r\n Then along that riverbank\r\n A thousand miles\r\n Tattooed cannibals danced in files;\r\n Then I heard the boom of the blood-lust song\r\n # A rapidly piling climax of speed and racket. #\r\n And a thigh-bone beating on a tin-pan gong.\r\n And \"BLOOD\" screamed the whistles and the fifes of the warriors,\r\n \"BLOOD\" screamed the skull-faced, lean witch-doctors,\r\n \"Whirl ye the deadly voo-doo rattle,\r\n Harry the uplands,\r\n Steal all the cattle,\r\n Rattle-rattle, rattle-rattle,\r\n Bing.\r\n Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, BOOM,\"\r\n # With a philosophic pause. #\r\n A roaring, epic, rag-time tune\r\n From the mouth of the Congo\r\n To the Mountains of the Moon.\r\n Death is an Elephant,\r\n # Shrilly and with a heavily accented metre. #\r\n Torch-eyed and horrible,\r\n Foam-flanked and terrible.\r\n BOOM, steal the pygmies,\r\n BOOM, kill the Arabs,\r\n BOOM, kill the white men,\r\n HOO, HOO, HOO.\r\n # Like the wind in the chimney. #\r\n Listen to the yell of Leopold's ghost\r\n Burning in Hell for his hand-maimed host.\r\n Hear how the demons chuckle and yell\r\n Cutting his hands off, down in Hell.\r\n Listen to the creepy proclamation,\r\n Blown through the lairs of the forest-nation,\r\n Blown past the white-ants' hill of clay,\r\n Blown past the marsh where the butterflies play: - \r\n \"Be careful what you do,\r\n # All the o sounds very golden.Heavy accents very heavy.\r\n Light accents very light.Last line whispered. #\r\n Or Mumbo-Jumbo, God of the Congo,\r\n And all of the other\r\n Gods of the Congo,\r\n Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you,\r\n Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you,\r\n Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you.\"\n\n\r\n II.Their Irrepressible High Spirits\n\r\n # Rather shrill and high. #\r\n Wild crap-shooters with a whoop and a call\r\n Danced the juba in their gambling-hall\r\n And laughed fit to kill, and shook the town,\r\n And guyed the policemen and laughed them down\r\n With a boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, BOOM.\r\n # Read exactly as in first section. #\r\n THEN I SAW THE CONGO, CREEPING THROUGH THE BLACK,\r\n CUTTING THROUGH THE FOREST WITH A GOLDEN TRACK.\r\n # Lay emphasis on the delicate ideas.\r\nKeep as light-footed as possible. #\r\n A negro fairyland swung into view,\r\n A minstrel river\r\n Where dreams come true.\r\n The ebony palace soared on high\r\n Through the blossoming trees to the evening sky.\r\n The inlaid porches and casements shone\r\n With gold and ivory and elephant-bone.\r\n And the black crowd laughed till their sides were sore\r\n At the baboon butler in the agate door,\r\n And the well-known tunes of the parrot band\r\n That trilled on the bushes of that magic land.\n\r\n # With pomposity. #\r\n A troupe of skull-faced witch-men came\r\n Through the agate doorway in suits of flame,\r\n Yea, long-tailed coats with a gold-leaf crust\r\n And hats that were covered with diamond-dust.\r\n And the crowd in the court gave a whoop and a call\r\n And danced the juba from wall to wall.\r\n # With a great deliberation and ghostliness. #\r\n But the witch-men suddenly stilled the throng\r\n With a stern cold glare, and a stern old song: - \r\n \"Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you.\"...\r\n # With overwhelming assurance, good cheer, and pomp. #\r\n Just then from the doorway, as fat as shotes,\r\n Came the cake-walk princes in their long red coats,\r\n Canes with a brilliant lacquer shine,\r\n And tall silk hats that were red as wine.\r\n # With growing speed and sharply marked dance-rhythm. #\r\n And they pranced with their butterfly partners there,\r\n Coal-black maidens with pearls in their hair,\r\n Knee-skirts trimmed with the jassamine sweet,\r\n And bells on their ankles and little black feet.\r\n And the couples railed at the chant and the frown\r\n Of the witch-men lean, and laughed them down.\r\n (O rare was the revel, and well worth while\r\n That made those glowering witch-men smile.)\n\r\n The cake-walk royalty then began\r\n To walk for a cake that was tall as a man\r\n To the tune of \"Boomlay, boomlay, BOOM,\"\r\n # With a touch of negro dialect,\r\nand as rapidly as possible toward the end. #\r\n While the witch-men laughed, with a sinister air,\r\n And sang with the scalawags prancing there: - \r\n \"Walk with care, walk with care,\r\n Or Mumbo-Jumbo, God of the Congo,\r\n And all of the other\r\n Gods of the Congo,\r\n Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you.\r\n Beware, beware, walk with care,\r\n Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom.\r\n Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom,\r\n Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom,\r\n Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay,\r\n BOOM.\"\r\n # Slow philosophic calm. #\r\n Oh rare was the revel, and well worth while\r\n That made those glowering witch-men smile.\n\n\r\n III.The Hope of their Religion\n\r\n # Heavy bass.With a literal imitation\r\nof camp-meeting racket, and trance. #\r\n A good old negro in the slums of the town\r\n Preached at a sister for her velvet gown.\r\n Howled at a brother for his low-down ways,\r\n His prowling, guzzling, sneak-thief days.\r\n Beat on the Bible till he wore it out\r\n Starting the jubilee revival shout.\r\n And some had visions, as they stood on chairs,\r\n And sang of Jacob, and the golden stairs,\r\n And they all repented, a thousand strong\r\n From their stupor and savagery and sin and wrong\r\n And slammed with their hymn books till they shook the room\r\n With \"glory, glory, glory,\"\r\n And \"Boom, boom, BOOM.\"\r\n # Exactly as in the first section.\r\nBegin with terror and power, end with joy. #\r\n THEN I SAW THE CONGO, CREEPING THROUGH THE BLACK\r\n CUTTING THROUGH THE JUNGLE WITH A GOLDEN TRACK.\r\n And the gray sky opened like a new-rent veil\r\n And showed the apostles with their coats of mail.\r\n In bright white steele they were seated round\r\n And their fire-eyes watched where the Congo wound.\r\n And the twelve Apostles, from their thrones on high\r\n Thrilled all the forest with their heavenly cry: - \r\n # Sung to the tune of \"Hark, ten thousand\r\nharps and voices\". #\r\n \"Mumbo-Jumbo will die in the jungle;\r\n Never again will he hoo-doo you,\r\n Never again will he hoo-doo you.\"\n\r\n # With growing deliberation and joy. #\r\n Then along that river, a thousand miles\r\n The vine-snared trees fell down in files.\r\n Pioneer angels cleared the way\r\n For a Congo paradise, for babes at play,\r\n For sacred capitals, for temples clean.\r\n Gone were the skull-faced witch-men lean.\r\n # In a rather high key - as delicately as possible. #\r\n There, where the wild ghost-gods had wailed\r\n A million boats of the angels sailed\r\n With oars of silver, and prows of blue\r\n And silken pennants that the sun shone through.\r\n 'Twas a land transfigured, 'twas a new creation.\r\n Oh, a singing wind swept the negro nation\r\n And on through the backwoods clearing flew: - \r\n # To the tune of \"Hark, ten thousand harps and voices\". #\r\n \"Mumbo-Jumbo is dead in the jungle.\r\n Never again will he hoo-doo you.\r\n Never again will he hoo-doo you.\"\n\r\n Redeemed were the forests, the beasts and the men,\r\n And only the vulture dared again\r\n By the far, lone mountains of the moon\r\n To cry, in the silence, the Congo tune: - \r\n # Dying down into a penetrating, terrified whisper. #\r\n \"Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you,\r\n Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you.\r\n Mumbo... Jumbo... will... hoo-doo... you.\"",

Bang! I slapped on the table bare\r\n A glittering heap of gold.\n\r\n \"Red flames will jewel my wine to-night;\r\n I'll loose my belt that you've lugged so tight;\r\n Ha! Ha! Dame Fortune is smiling bright;\r\n The stuff of my brain I've sold;\r\n Canaille of the gutter, up! Away!\r\n You've battened on me for a bitter-long day;\r\n But I'm driving you forth, and forever and aye,\r\n Hunger and Thirst and Cold.\"\n\r\n So I kicked them out with a scornful roar;\r\n Yet, oh, they turned at the garret door;\r\n Quietly there they spoke once more:\r\n \"The tale is not all told.\r\n It's au revoir, but it's not good-by;\r\n We're yours, old chap, till the day you die;\r\n Laugh on, you fool! Oh, you'll never defy\r\n Hunger and Thirst and Cold.\"",

          " As Lucy went a-walking one morning cold and fine,\r\n There sate three crows upon a bough, and three times three is nine:\r\n Then \"O!\" said Lucy, in the snow, \"it's very plain to see\r\n A witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me.\"\n\r\n Then stept she light and heedfully across the frozen snow,\r\n And plucked a bunch of elder-twigs that near a pool did grow:\r\n And, by and by, she comes to seven shadows in one place\r\n Stretched black by seven poplar-trees against the sun's bright face.\n\r\n She looks to left, she looks to right, and in the midst she sees\r\n A little pool of water clear and frozen 'neath the trees;\r\n Then down beside its margent in the crusty snow she kneels,\r\n And hears a magic belfry a-ringing with sweet bells.\n\n\n\r\n Clear sang the faint far merry peal, then silence on the air,\r\n And icy-still the frozen pool and poplars standing there:\r\n Then lo! as Lucy turned her head and looked along the snow\r\n She sees a witch - a witch she sees, come frisking to and fro.\n\r\n Her scarlet, buckled shoes they clicked, her heels a-twinkling high;\r\n With mistletoe her steeple-hat bobbed as she capered by;\r\n But never a dint, or mark, or print, in the whiteness for to see,\r\n Though danced she high, though danced she fast, though danced she lissomely.\n\r\n It seemed 'twas diamonds in the air, or little flakes of frost;\r\n It seemed 'twas golden smoke around, or sunbeams lightly tossed;\r\n It seemed an elfin music like to reeds and warblers rose:\r\n \"Nay!\" Lucy said, \"it is the wind that through the branches flows.\"\n\r\n And as she peeps, and as she peeps, 'tis no more one, but three,\r\n And eye of bat, and downy wing of owl within the tree,\r\n And the bells of that sweet belfry a-pealing as before\r\n And now it is not three she sees, and now it is not four - \n\r\n \"O! who are ye,\" sweet Lucy cries, \"that in a dreadful ring,\r\n All muffled up in brindled shawls, do caper, frisk, and spring?\"\r\n \"A witch, and witches, one and nine,\" they straight to her reply,\r\n And looked upon her narrowly, with green and needle eye.\n\r\n Then Lucy sees in clouds of gold green cherry trees up-grow,\r\n And bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow;\r\n She smells, all faint, the almond-boughs blowing so wild and fair\r\n And doves with milky eyes ascend fluttering in the air.\n\r\n Clear flowers she sees, like tulip buds, go floating by like birds,\r\n With wavering tips that warbled sweetly strange enchanted words;\r\n And, as with ropes of amethyst, the boughs with lamps were hung,\r\n And clusters of green emeralds like fruit upon them clung.\n\r\n \"O witches nine, ye dreadful nine, O witches seven and three!\r\n Whence come these wondrous things that I this Christmas morning see?\"\r\n But straight, as in a clap, when she of Christmas says the word,\r\n Here is the snow, and there the sun, but never bloom nor bird;\n\r\n Nor warbling flame, nor gleaming-rope of amethyst there shows,\r\n Nor bunches of green emeralds, nor belfry, well, and rose,\r\n Nor cloud of gold, nor cherry-tree, nor witch in brindle shawl,\r\n But like a dream that vanishes, so vanished were they all.\n\r\n When Lucy sees, and only sees three crows upon a bough,\r\n And earthly twigs, and bushes hidden white in driven snow,\r\n Then \"O!\" said Lucy, \"three times three is nine - I plainly see\r\n Some witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me.\"\n",

Deep in soft, cool shadows,--\r\nMoving all together when the west wind blows\r\nFragrance upon fragrance over road and meadows--\r\nI'm smelling heat and oil and sweat, and thick, black clothes.\n\r\nOrchards in the Spring-time!

          "Once when the snow of the year was beginning to fall,\r\nWe stopped by a mountain pasture to say, 'Whose colt?'\r\nA little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall,\r\nThe other curled at his breast. He dipped his head\r\nAnd snorted to us. And then we saw him bolt.\r\nWe heard the miniature thunder where he fled,\r\nAnd we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and gray,\r\nLike a shadow across instead of behind the flakes.\r\nThe little fellow's afraid of the falling snow.\r\nHe never saw it before. It isn't play\r\nWith the little fellow at all. He's running away.\r\nHe wouldn't believe when his mother told him, 'Sakes,\r\nIt's only weather.' He thought she didn't know!\r\nSo this is something he has to bear alone\r\nAnd now he comes again with a clatter of stone,\r\nHe mounts the wall again with whited eyes\r\nDilated nostrils, and tail held straight up straight.\r\nHe shudders his coat as if to throw off flies.\r\n'Whoever it is that leaves him out so late,\r\nWhen all other creatures have gone to stall and bin,\r\nOught to be told to come and take him in.'

I know the grouping pines that crown\r\nThe long green hill and fling their darkness down,\r\nA never-dying shadow; and well I know\r\nHow in the late months the whole wide woodland burns\r\nUnsmoking, and the earth hangs still as still.\r\nI know the town, the hamlets and the lone\r\nShelterless cottage where the wind's least tone\r\nIs magnified, and his far-flung thundering shout\r\nBrings near the incredible end of the world. I know!\r\nEven in sleep-walk I should linger about\r\nThose lanes, those streets sure-footed, and by the unfenced stream go,\r\nHearing the swift waters past the locked mill flow.\r\nWhere is that country? It lies in my mind,\r\nIts trees and grassy shape and white-gashed hill\r\nAnd springs and wind and weather; its village stone\r\nAnd solitary stone are in my mind;\r\nAnd every thought familiarly returns\r\nTo find its home, and birdlike circling still\r\nAbove the smouldering beeches of November\r\nAnd the bare elms and rattled hedgerows of December.\r\nThat native country lies deep in my mind\r\nFor every thought and true affection's home.\r\nAnd like that mental land are you become,\r\nPart of that land, and I the thought that turns\r\nTowards home. And as in that familiar land I find\r\nMyself among each tree, spring, road and hill,\r\nAnd at each present step my past footsteps remember;\r\nSo you in all my inward being lies,\r\nIn you my history, my earth and stream and skies.\r\nYour late fire is it that in my boughs yet burns,\r\nYour stone that to my passing footfall cries.",

Yet I still felt lost and wonder why.\n\r\nEven the beech tree from next door which shares\r\nIts shadow with me, seemed a kind of threat.\r\nEverything was too neat, and someone cares\n\r\nIn the wrong way.

Just then he came along\r\nAnd stopped on the stairs and turned and looked at me,\r\nAnd took the cigar from his mouth and sort of smiled\r\nAnd said, 'Say, what's the matter?' and then came down\r\nWhere I was leaning against the wall,\r\nAnd touched my shoulder, and put his arm around me . . .\r\nAnd I was so sad, thinking about it,\r\nThinking that it was raining, and a cold night,\r\nWith Jim so unaccustomed to being dead,\r\nThat I was happy to have him sympathize,\r\nTo feel his arm, and leaned against him and cried.\r\nAnd before I knew it, he got me into a room\r\nWhere a table was set, and no one there,\r\nAnd sat me down on a sofa, and held me close,\r\nAnd talked to me, telling me not to cry,\r\nThat it was all right, he'd look after me,\r\nBut not to cry, my eyes were getting red,\r\nWhich didn't make me pretty. And he was so nice,\r\nThat when he turned my face between his hands,\r\nAnd looked at me, with those blue eyes of his,\r\nAnd smiled, and leaned, and kissed me,\r\nSomehow I couldn't tell him not to do it,\r\nSomehow I didn't mind, I let him kiss me,\r\nAnd closed my eyes! . . . Well, that was how it started.\r\nFor when my heart was eased with crying, and grief\r\nHad passed and left me quiet, somehow it seemed\r\nAs if it wasn't honest to change my mind,\r\nTo send him away, or say I hadn't meant it,\r\nAnd, anyway, it seemed so hard to explain!\r\nAnd so we sat and talked, not talking much,\r\nBut meaning as much in silence as in words,\r\nThere in that empty room with palms about us,\r\nThat private dining-room . . . And as we sat there\r\nI felt my future changing, day by day,\r\nWith unknown streets opening left and right,\r\nNew streets with farther lights, new taller houses,\r\nDoors swinging into hallways filled with light,\r\nHalf-opened luminous windows, with white curtains\r\nStreaming out in the night, and sudden music,\r\nAnd thinking of this, and through it half remembering\r\nA quick and horrible death, my husband's eyes,\r\nThe broken-plastered walls, my boy asleep,\r\nIt seemed as if my brain would break in two.\r\nMy voice began to tremble . . . and when I stood,\r\nAnd told him I must go, and said good-night,\r\nI couldn't see the end. How would it end?\r\nWould he return to-morrow? Or would he not?\r\nAnd did I want him to, or would I rather\r\nLook for another job? He took my shoulders\r\nBetween his hands, and looked down into my eyes,\r\nAnd smiled, and said good-night. If he had kissed me,\r\nThat would have, well, I don't know; but he didn't . .\r\nAnd so I went downstairs, then, half elated,\r\nHoping to close the door before that party\r\nIn number four should sing that song again,\r\n'They'll soon be lighting candles round a box with silver handles',\r\nAnd sure enough, I did. I faced the darkness.\r\nAnd my eyes were filled with tears. And I was happy.",
          "I\n\r\nHot through Troy's ruin Menelaus broke\r\nTo Priam's palace, sword in hand, to sate\r\nOn that adulterous whore a ten years' hate\r\nAnd a king's honour. Through red death, and smoke,\r\nAnd cries, and then by quieter ways he strode,\r\nTill the still innermost chamber fronted him.\r\nHe swung his sword, and crashed into the dim\r\nLuxurious bower, flaming like a god.\n\r\nHigh sat white Helen, lonely and serene.\r\nHe had not remembered that she was so fair,\r\nAnd that her neck curved down in such a way;\r\nAnd he felt tired. He flung the sword away,\r\nAnd kissed her feet, and knelt before her there,\r\nThe perfect Knight before the perfect Queen.\n\n\r\nII\n\r\nSo far the poet. How should he behold\r\nThat journey home, the long connubial years?\r\nHe does not tell you how white Helen bears\r\nChild on legitimate child, becomes a scold,\r\nHaggard with virtue. Menelaus bold\r\nWaxed garrulous, and sacked a hundred Troys\r\n'Twixt noon and supper. And her golden voice\r\nGot shrill as he grew deafer. And both were old.\n\r\nOften he wonders why on earth he went\r\nTroyward, or why poor Paris ever came.\r\nOft she weeps, gummy-eyed and impotent;\r\nHer dry shanks twitch at Paris' mumbled name.\r\nSo Menelaus nagged; and Helen cried;\r\nAnd Paris slept on by Scamander side.",

          "When the spent sun throws up its rays on cloud\r\nAnd goes down burning into the gulf below,\r\nNo voice in nature is heard to cry aloud\r\nAt what has happened. Birds, at least must know\r\nIt is the change to darkness in the sky.\r\nMurmuring something quiet in her breast,\r\nOne bird begins to close a faded eye;\r\nOr overtaken too far from his nest,\r\nHurrying low above the grove, some waif\r\nSwoops just in time to his remembered tree.\r\nAt most he thinks or twitters softly, 'Safe!\r\nNow let the night be dark for all of me.\r\nLet the night bee too dark for me to see\r\nInto the future. Let what will be, be.'",
          " (The Dark Side)\n\r\nMy mind goes back to Fumin Wood, and how we stuck it out,\r\nEight days of hunger, thirst and cold, mowed down by steel and flame;\r\nWaist-deep in mud and mad with woe, with dead men all about,\r\nWe fought like fiends and waited for relief that never came.\r\nEight days and nights they rolled on us in battle-frenzied mass!\r\n\"Debout les morts!\" We hurled them back. By God! they did not pass.\n\r\nThey pinned two medals on my chest, a yellow and a brown,\r\nAnd lovely ladies made me blush, such pretty words they said.\r\nI felt a cheerful man, almost, until my eyes went down,\r\nAnd there I saw the blankets - how they sagged upon my bed.\r\nAnd then again I drank the cup of sorrow to the dregs:\r\nOh, they can keep their medals if they give me back my legs.\n\r\nI think of how I used to run and leap and kick the ball,\r\nAnd ride and dance and climb the hills and frolic in the sea;\r\nAnd all the thousand things that now I'll never do at all. . . .\r\nMon Dieu! there's nothing left in life, it often seems to me.\r\nAnd as the nurses lift me up and strap me in my chair,\r\nIf they would chloroform me off I feel I wouldn't care.\n\r\nAh yes! we're \"heroes all\" to-day - they point to us with pride;\r\nTo-day their hearts go out to us, the tears are in their eyes!\r\nBut wait a bit; to-morrow they will blindly look aside;\r\nNo more they'll talk of what they owe, the dues of sacrifice\r\n(One hates to be reminded of an everlasting debt).\r\nIt's all in human nature. Ah! the world will soon forget.\n\r\nMy mind goes back to where I lay wound-rotted on the plain,\r\nAnd ate the muddy mangold roots, and drank the drops of dew,\r\nAnd dragged myself for miles and miles when every move was pain,\r\nAnd over me the carrion-crows were retching as they flew.\r\nOh, ere I closed my eyes and stuck my rifle in the air\r\nI wish that those who picked me up had passed and left me there.",
          "'And am I then a pyramid?' says Senlin,\r\n'In which are caves and coffins, where lies hidden\r\nSome old and mocking hieroglyph of flesh?\r\nOr am I rather the moonlight, spreading subtly\r\nAbove those stones and times?\r\nOr the green blade of grass that bravely grows\r\nBetween to massive boulders of black basalt\r\nYear after year, and fades and blows?\r\nSenlin, sitting before us in the lamplight,\r\nLaughs, and lights his pipe. The yellow flame\r\nMinutely flares in his eyes, minutely dwindles.\r\nDoes a blade of grass have Senlin for a name?\r\nYet we would say that we have seen him somewhere,\r\nA tiny spear of green beneath the blue,\r\nPlaying his destiny in a sun-warmed crevice\r\nWith the gigantic fates of frost and dew.\r\nDoes a spider come and spin his gossamer ladder\r\nRung by silver rung,\r\nChaining it fast to Senlin? Its faint shadow\r\nFlung, waveringly, where his is flung?\r\nDoes a raindrop dazzle starlike down his length\r\nTrying his futile strength?\r\nA snowflake startle him? The stars defeat him?\r\nThrough aeons of dusk have birds above him sung?\r\nTime is a wind, says Senlin; time, like music,\r\nBlows over us its mournful beauty, passes,\r\nAnd leaves behind a shadowy reflection,\r\nA helpless gesture of mist above the grasses.",

          "She turned her head on the pillow, and cried once more.\r\nAnd drawing a shaken breath, and closing her eyes,\r\nTo shut out, if she could, this dingy room,\r\nThe wigs and costumes scattered around the floor,\r\nYellows and greens in the dark, she walked again\r\nThose nightmare streets which she had walked so often . . .\r\nHere, at a certain corner, under an arc-lamp,\r\nBlown by a bitter wind, she stopped and looked\r\nIn through the brilliant windows of a drug-store,\r\nAnd wondered if she dared to ask for poison:\r\nBut it was late, few customers were there,\r\nThe eyes of all the clerks would freeze upon her,\r\nAnd she would wilt, and cry . . . Here, by the river,\r\nShe listened to the water slapping the wall,\r\nAnd felt queer fascination in its blackness:\r\nBut it was cold, the little waves looked cruel,\r\nThe stars were keen, and a windy dash of spray\r\nStruck her cheek, and withered her veins . . . And so\r\nShe dragged herself once more to home, and bed.\n\r\nPaul hadn't guessed it yet, though twice, already,\r\nShe'd fainted, once, the first time, on the stage.\r\nSo she must tell him soon, or else, get out . . .\r\nHow could she say it? That was the hideous thing.\r\nShe'd rather die than say it! . . . and all the trouble,\r\nMonths when she couldn't earn a cent, and then,\r\nIf he refused to marry her . . . well, what?\r\nShe saw him laughing, making a foolish joke,\r\nHis grey eyes turning quickly; and the words\r\nFled from her tongue . . . She saw him sitting silent,\r\nBrooding over his morning coffee, maybe,\r\nAnd tried again . . . she bit her lips, and trembled,\r\nAnd looked away, and said . . . 'Say Paul, boy, listen,\r\nThere's something I must tell you . . . ' There she stopped,\r\nWondering what he'd say . . . What would he say?\r\n'Spring it, kid! Don't look so serious!'\r\n'But what I've got to say, IS, serious!'\r\nThen she could see how, suddenly, he would sober,\r\nHis eyes would darken, he'd look so terrifying,\r\nHe always did, and what could she do but cry?\r\nPerhaps, then, he would guess, perhaps he wouldn't.\r\nAnd if he didn't, but asked her 'What's the matter?'\r\nShe knew she'd never tell, just say she was sick . . .\r\nAnd after that, when would she dare again?\r\nAnd what would he do, even suppose she told him?\n\r\nIf it were Felix! If it were only Felix!\r\nShe wouldn't mind so much. But as it was,\r\nBitterness choked her, she had half a mind\r\nTo pay out Felix for never having liked her,\r\nBy making people think that it was he . . .\r\nShe'd write a letter to someone, before she died,\r\nJust saying 'Felix did it, and wouldn't marry.'\r\nAnd then she'd die . . . But that was hard on Paul . . .\r\nPaul would never forgive her, he'd never forgive her!\r\nSometimes she almost thought Paul really loved her . . .\r\nShe saw him look reproachfully at her coffin.\n\r\nAnd then she closed her eyes and walked again\r\nThose nightmare streets that she had walked so often:\r\nUnder an arc-lamp swinging in the wind\r\nShe stood, and stared in through a drug-store window,\r\nWatching a clerk wrap up a little pill-box.\r\nBut it was late. No customers were there,\r\nPitiless eyes would freeze her secret in her!\r\nAnd then, what poison would she dare to ask for?\r\nAnd if they asked her why, what would she say?",
          "Here, in this other world, they come and go\r\nWith easy dream-like movements to and fro.\r\nThey stare through lovely eyes, yet do not seek\r\nAn answering gaze, or that a man should speak.\r\nHad I a load of gold, and should I come\r\nBribing their friendship, and to buy a home,\r\nThey would stare harder and would slightly frown:\r\nI am a stranger from the distant town.\n\r\nOh, with what patience I have tried to win\r\nThe favour of the hostess of the Inn!\r\nHave I not offered toast on frothing toast\r\nLooking toward the melancholy host;\r\nPraised the old wall-eyed mare to please the groom;\r\nLaughed to the laughing maid and fetched her broom;\r\nStood in the background not to interfere\r\nWhen the cool ancients frolicked at their beer;\r\nTalked only in my turn, and made no claim\r\nFor recognition or by voice or name,\r\nContent to listen, and to watch the blue\r\nOr grey of eyes, or what good hands can do?\n\r\nSun-freckled lads, who at the dusk of day\r\nStroll through the village with a scent of hay\r\nClinging about you from the windy hill,\r\nWhy do you keep your secret from me still?\r\nYou loiter at the corner of the street;\r\nI in the distance silently entreat.\r\nI know too well I'm city-soiled, but then\r\nSo are today ten million other men.\r\nMy heart is true: I've neither will nor charms\r\nTo lure away your maidens from your arms.\r\nTrust me a little. Must I always stand\r\nLonely, a stranger from an unknown land?\n\r\nThere is a riddle here. Though I'm more wise\r\nThan you, I cannot read your simple eyes.\r\nI find the meaning of their gentle look\r\nMore difficult than any learned book.\r\nI pass: perhaps a moment you may chaff\r\nMy walk, and so dismiss me with a laugh.\r\nI come: you all, most grave and most polite,\r\nStand silent first, then wish me calm Good-Night.\r\nWhen I go back to town some one will say:\r\n'I think that stranger must have gone away.'\r\nAnd 'Surely!' some one else will then reply.\r\nMeanwhile, within the dark of London, I\r\nShall, with my forehead resting on my hand,\r\nNot cease remembering your distant land;\r\nEndeavouring to reconstruct aright\r\nHow some treed hill has looked in evening light;\r\nOr be imagining the blue of skies\r\nNow as in heaven, now as in your eyes;\r\nOr in my mind confusing looks or words\r\nOf yours with dawnlight, or the song of birds:\r\nNot able to resist, not even keep\r\nMyself from hovering near you in my sleep:\r\nYou still as callous to my thought and me\r\nAs flowers to the purpose of the bee.\n",
          "I've a lily of the Valley\r\nThat I'm keeping here for you;\r\nI care for and protect it,\r\nAnd water it with dew.\r\nIt is a living emblem\r\nOf the wonderful domain,\r\nWhere all is pure and love-like,\r\nAnd where we feel no pain.\n\r\nYes, the Lily of the Valley\r\nIs a tie twixt you and me;\r\nFor every time you see one\r\nThink how happy I must be.\r\nI'm an atom of the infinite,\r\nHow wonderful it seems;\r\nYet from your sphere the finite\r\nBut a thin veil intervenes.",
          "Of what she said to me that night, no matter.\r\nThe strange thing came next day.\r\nMy brain was full of music, something she played me;\r\nI couldn't remember it all, but phrases of it\r\nWreathed and wreathed among faint memories,\r\nSeeking for something, trying to tell me something,\r\nUrging to restlessness: verging on grief.\r\nI tried to play the tune, from memory,\r\nBut memory failed: the chords and discords climbed\r\nAnd found no resolution, only hung there,\r\nAnd left me morbid . . . Where, then, had I heard it? . . .\r\nWhat secret dusty chamber was it hinting?\r\n'Dust', it said, 'dust . . . and dust . . . and sunlight . .\r\nA cold clear April evening . . . snow, bedraggled,\r\nRain-worn snow, dappling the hideous grass . . .\r\nAnd someone walking alone; and someone saying\r\nThat all must end, for the time had come to go . . . '\r\nThese were the phrases . . . but behind, beneath them\r\nA greater shadow moved: and in this shadow\r\nI stood and guessed . . . Was it the blue-eyed lady?\r\nThe one who always danced in golden slippers,\r\nAnd had I danced with her, upon this music?\r\nOr was it further back, the unplumbed twilight\r\nOf childhood? No, much recenter than that.\n\r\nYou know, without my telling you, how sometimes\r\nA word or name eludes you, and you seek it\r\nThrough running ghosts of shadow, leaping at it,\r\nLying in wait for it to spring upon it,\r\nSpreading faint snares for it of sense or sound:\r\nUntil, of a sudden, as if in a phantom forest,\r\nYou hear it, see it flash among the branches,\r\nAnd scarcely knowing how, suddenly have it,\r\nWell, it was so I followed down this music,\r\nGlimpsing a face in darkness, hearing a cry,\r\nRemembering days forgotten, moods exhausted,\r\nCorners in sunlight, puddles reflecting stars;\r\nUntil, of a sudden, and least of all suspected,\r\nThe thing resolved itself: and I remembered\r\nAn April afternoon, eight years ago,\r\nOr was it nine? no matter, call it nine,\r\nA room in which the last of sunlight faded;\r\nA vase of violets, fragrance in white curtains;\r\nAnd, she who played the same thing later, playing.\n\r\nShe played this tune. And in the middle of it\r\nAbruptly broke it off, letting her hands\r\nFall in her lap. She sat there so a moment,\r\nWith shoulders drooped, then lifted up a rose,\r\nOne great white rose, wide opened like a lotos,\r\nAnd pressed it to her cheek, and closed her eyes.\n\r\n'You know, we've got to end this, Miriam loves you . . .\r\nIf she should ever know, or even guess it,\r\nWhat would she do? Listen! I'm not absurd . . .\r\nI'm sure of it. If you had eyes, for women,\r\nTo understand them, which you've never had,\r\nYou'd know it too . . . ' So went this colloquy,\r\nHalf humorous, with undertones of pathos,\r\nHalf grave, half flippant . . . while her fingers, softly,\r\nFelt for this tune, played it and let it fall,\r\nNow note by singing note, now chord by chord,\r\nRepeating phrases with a kind of pleasure . . .\r\nWas it symbolic of the woman's weakness\r\nThat she could neither break it, nor conclude?\r\nIt paused . . . and wandered . . . paused again; while she,\r\nPerplexed and tired, half told me I must go,\r\nHalf asked me if I thought I ought to go . . .\n\r\nWell, April passed with many other evenings,\r\nEvenings like this, with later suns and warmer,\r\nWith violets always there, and fragrant curtains . . .\r\nAnd she was right: and Miriam found it out . . .\r\nAnd after that, when eight deep years had passed,\r\nOr nine, we met once more, by accident . . .\r\nBut was it just by accident, I wonder,\r\nShe played this tune? Or what, then, was intended? . . .",
          "From babyhood I have known the beauty of earth, \r\nI learnt it, I think, in the strange months before birth,\r\nI learnt it passing and passing by each moon\r\nFrom the harvest month into my natal June.\r\nMy mother, the dear, the lovely I hardly knew,\r\nBearing me must have walked and wandered through\r\nStubble of silver or gold, as moon or sun\r\nLit earth in the days when my body was begun.\r\nAnd then October with leaves splendid and blown\r\nShe watched with my little body a little grown,\r\nAnd winter fell, and into our being passed\r\nFirm frost and icy rivers and the blast\r\nOf winds that on the iron clods of plough\r\nBeat with an unseen charging. Then the bough\r\nOf spring came green, and her glad body stirred\r\nWith a son's wombed leaping, and she heard\r\nSongs of the air and woods and waterways,\r\nAnd with them singing the coming of my days.\r\nAnd nesting time drew on to summer flowers,\r\nAnd me unborn she taught through patient hours.\r\nThen on that first June day, with spices blown\r\nOf roses over clover crops unmown,\r\nAnd grey wind-lifted leaves and blossom of bean,\r\nShe gave her dear white beauty to the keen\r\nAnguish of women, and brought my body to birth\r\nAlready skilled in the sculptures of the earth.\n\r\nThen in the days when her breasts nourished me,\r\nDaily she walked, that happy girl, to see\r\nHow summer prospered to bring the harvest on,\r\nAnd how the gardens and how the orchards shone\r\nWith scarlet and blue and yellow flowers and fruit,\r\nAnd hear with equal love the lonely flute\r\nOf legendary satyrs in the wood,\r\nOr the still voice of Christ in bachelorhood.\r\nAnd she would come I know to me her son\r\nWith lovely secret gossip of journeys done\r\nIn fields where some day my own feet should go.\r\nIt was not gossip in words that I could not know,\r\nMere ease and pleasure for her mother wit,\r\nBut such as I could feel the joy of it\r\nBeating about my baby blood and sense,\r\nMaternal tending of intelligence\r\nIn the unwhispered rites of bosom and lip,\r\nDivinings worded in bodily fellowship.\r\nAnd every shape and colour and scent she knew,\r\nWere intimations winding, folding, through\r\nMy infancies of flesh and thought, each one\r\nTo find its unblemished record and copy done\r\nIn little moods drawn from the suckling-breast...\r\nThat now, in manhood, when I find the nest\r\nOf the chaffinch moulded in the elder tree,\r\nAnd looking on that lichen cup can see\r\nThe images of eternity and space\r\nLavished upon a small bird's dwelling-place:\r\nOr when from some blue passage of the sky\r\nI know that also colour can prophesy:\r\nOr, ghosted on the brushing tides of wheat,\r\nThe gossip of a Galilean street,\r\nSo many Sabbaths gone, I hear again,\r\nAnd his hands plucking that immortal grain:\r\nOr when by spectral ancestries I pass\r\nAgain to Eden, as the orchard grass\r\nGives out the scent of mellow apples blown\r\nFrom windy boughs, all these, I know, were known\r\nBy that dear mother when the boy to come\r\nWas the zeal and gospel of her martyrdom.\n\r\nThen came the time when I could walk with her,\r\nWe pilgrims of the fields, with everywhere\r\nStrange leaves, and spreading of earth, and hedgerow themes,\r\nAnd mossy walls, and bubbling of the streams,\r\nAnd the way of clouds, and the full moon to wane,\r\nThe bird-song in the lilacs after rain,\r\nAnd month by month the coming of the flowers,\r\nfor me to learn in speech, as had been ours\r\nKnowledge unspoken while she fashioned me...\r\nAnd then she died; and I went on to be\r\nThrough lonely boyhood her disciple still,\r\nA wanderer by many a Berkshire hill,\r\nBy water-meadows of the Oxford plain,\r\nBy the thick oaks of Avon, with the strain\r\nOf an old yeoman wisdom dreaming on\r\nNew beauty ever following beauty gone,\r\nUntil I knew my earth and her raiment fair\r\nIn every difference of the seasons' wear,\r\nLong years her scholar, with learning of her ways\r\nTo slip unleasht all singing into praise\r\nShould learning yet by some enchantment be\r\nBidden to passion's better husbandry.\n\r\nAnd the enchanted bidding fell. And you,\r\nO Love, it was that spelt the earth anew.\n\r\nO Love, you silent wayfarer,\r\nHow many years all unaware\r\nBy blackthorn hedge, and spinney green\r\nWith larch, I wandered, while unseen\r\nYou in my shadow walked, nor made\r\nEven a whisper in the shade.\n\r\nO Love, on many an evening hill\r\nI watched the day go down, the still\r\nDark woods, the far great rivers wind,\r\nThin threads of light. And I was blind,\r\nOr seeing knew not, for you were\r\nBeside me still, yet hidden there.\n\r\nO Love, as year by year went on,\r\nAnd budding primroses were gone,\r\nAnd berries fell, and still the bright\r\nCrocuses came in the night,\r\nYou left me to my task alone,\r\nO Love, so near me and unknown.\n\r\nO Love, though she who bore me set\r\nEarth's love for ever on me, yet\r\nSome word withheld still troubled me,\r\nSome presence that I could not see,\r\nTill you, dear alien, should come,\r\nAnd doctrine be no longer dumb.\n\r\nO Love, one April night I heard\r\nThe doctrine's everlasting word,\r\nAnd you beneath that starry sky,\r\nUnknown, were with me suddenly,\r\nYet there was no new meeting then,\r\nBut some old marriage come again.\n\r\nO Love, and now is earth my friend,\r\nTelling me all, until the end\r\nWhen I shall in the earth be laid\r\nWith all my maps and fancies made,\r\nAnd you, Love, were the secret earth\r\nOf my blind following from birth.\n\r\nO Love, you happy wayfarer,\r\nBe still my fond interpreter,\r\nOf all the glory that can be\r\nAs once on starlit Winchelsea,\r\nFinding upon my pilgrim way\r\nA burning bush for every day.\n",
          "The Bishop tells us: \"When the boys come back\r\nThey will not be the same; for they'll have fought\r\nIn a just cause: they lead the last attack\r\nOn Anti-Christ; their comrade's blood has bought\r\nNew right to breed an honourable race.\r\nThey have challenged Death and dared him face to face.\"\n\r\n\"We're none of us the same!\" the boys reply.\r\n\"For George lost both his legs; and Bill's stone blind;\r\nPoor Jim's shot through the lungs and like to die;\r\nAnd Bert's gone syphilitic: you'll not find\r\nA chap who's served that hasn't found some change.\"\r\nAnd the Bishop said; \"The ways of God are strange!\"",
          "I stood by the shore at the death of day,\r\nAs the sun sank flaming red;\r\nAnd the face of the waters that spread away\r\nWas as gray as the face of the dead.\n\r\nAnd I heard the cry of the wanton sea\r\nAnd the moan of the wailing wind;\r\nFor love's sweet pain in his heart had he,\r\nBut the gray old sea had sinned.\n\r\nThe wind was young and the sea was old,\r\nBut their cries went up together;\r\nThe wind was warm and the sea was cold,\r\nFor age makes wintry weather.\n\r\nSo they cried aloud and they wept amain,\r\nTill the sky grew dark to hear it;\r\nAnd out of its folds crept the misty rain,\r\nIn its shroud, like a troubled spirit.\n\r\nFor the wind was wild with a hopeless love,\r\nAnd the sea was sad at heart\r\nAt many a crime that he wot of,\r\nWherein he had played his part.\n\r\nHe thought of the gallant ships gone down\r\nBy the will of his wicked waves;\r\nAnd he thought how the church-yard in the town\r\nHeld the sea-made widows' graves.\n\r\nThe wild wind thought of the love he had left\r\nAfar in an Eastern land,\r\nAnd he longed, as long the much bereft,\r\nFor the touch of her perfumed hand.\n\r\nIn his winding wail and his deep-heaved sigh\r\nHis aching grief found vent;\r\nWhile the sea looked up at the bending sky\r\nAnd murmured: \"I repent.\"\n\r\nBut e'en as he spoke, a ship came by\r\nThat bravely ploughed the main,\r\nAnd a light came into the sea's green eye,\r\nAnd his heart grew hard again.\n\r\nThen he spoke to the wind: \"Friend, seest thou not\r\nYon vessel is eastward bound?\r\nPray speed with it to the happy spot\r\nWhere thy loved one may be found.\"\n\r\nAnd the wind rose up in a dear delight,\r\nAnd after the good ship sped;\r\nBut the crafty sea by his wicked might\r\nKept the vessel ever ahead.\n\r\nTill the wind grew fierce in his despair,\r\nAnd white on the brow and lip.\r\nHe tore his garments and tore his hair,\r\nAnd fell on the flying ship.\n\r\nAnd the ship went down, for a rock was there,\r\nAnd the sailless sea loomed black;\r\nWhile burdened again with dole and care,\r\nThe wind came moaning back.\n\r\nAnd still he moans from his bosom hot\r\nWhere his raging grief lies pent,\r\nAnd ever when the ships come not,\r\nThe sea says: \"I repent.\"",
          "Safe in the magic of my woods\r\nI lay, and watched the dying light.\r\nFaint in the pale high solitudes,\r\nAnd washed with rain and veiled by night,\n\r\nSilver and blue and green were showing.\r\nAnd the dark woods grew darker still;\r\nAnd birds were hushed; and peace was growing;\r\nAnd quietness crept up the hill;\n\r\nAnd no wind was blowing\n\r\nAnd I knew\r\nThat this was the hour of knowing,\r\nAnd the night and the woods and you\r\nWere one together, and I should find\r\nSoon in the silence the hidden key\r\nOf all that had hurt and puzzled me\r\nWhy you were you, and the night was kind,\r\nAnd the woods were part of the heart of me.\n\r\nAnd there I waited breathlessly,\r\nAlone; and slowly the holy three,\r\nThe three that I loved, together grew\r\nOne, in the hour of knowing,\r\nNight, and the woods, and you....\n\r\nAnd suddenly\r\nThere was an uproar in my woods,\n\r\nThe noise of a fool in mock distress,\r\nCrashing and laughing and blindly going,\r\nOf ignorant feet and a swishing dress,\r\nAnd a Voice profaning the solitudes.\n\r\nThe spell was broken, the key denied me\r\nAnd at length your flat clear voice beside me\r\nMouthed cheerful clear flat platitudes.\n\r\nYou came and quacked beside me in the wood.\r\nYou said, \"The view from here is very good!\"\r\nYou said, \"It's nice to be alone a bit!\"\r\nAnd, \"How the days are drawing out!\" you said.\r\nYou said, \"The sunset's pretty, isn't it?\"\n\r\n* * * * *\n\r\nBy God!

          "All I could see from where I stood\r\nWas three long mountains and a wood;\r\nI turned and looked another way,\r\nAnd saw three islands in a bay.\r\nSo with my eyes I traced the line\r\nOf the horizon, thin and fine,\r\nStraight around till I was come\r\nBack to where I'd started from;\r\nAnd all I saw from where I stood\r\nWas three long mountains and a wood.\r\nOver these things I could not see;\r\nThese were the things that bounded me;\r\nAnd I could touch them with my hand,\r\nAlmost, I thought, from where I stand.\r\nAnd all at once things seemed so small\r\nMy breath came short, and scarce at all.\r\nBut, sure, the sky is big, I said;\r\nMiles and miles above my head;\r\nSo here upon my back I'll lie\r\nAnd look my fill into the sky.\r\nAnd so I looked, and, after all,\r\nThe sky was not so very tall.\r\nThe sky, I said, must somewhere stop,\r\nAnd--sure enough!--I see the top!\r\nThe sky, I thought, is not so grand;\r\nI 'most could touch it with my hand!\r\nAnd reaching up my hand to try,\r\nI screamed to feel it touch the sky.\r\nI screamed, and--lo!--Infinity\r\nCame down and settled over me;\r\nForced back my scream into my chest,\r\nBent back my arm upon my breast,\r\nAnd, pressing of the Undefined\r\nThe definition on my mind,\r\nHeld up before my eyes a glass\r\nThrough which my shrinking sight did pass\r\nUntil it seemed I must behold\r\nImmensity made manifold;\r\nWhispered to me a word whose sound\r\nDeafened the air for worlds around,\r\nAnd brought unmuffled to my ears\r\nThe gossiping of friendly spheres,\r\nThe creaking of the tented sky,\r\nThe ticking of Eternity.\r\nI saw and heard, and knew at last\r\nThe How and Why of all things, past,\r\nAnd present, and forevermore.\r\nThe Universe, cleft to the core,\r\nLay open to my probing sense\r\nThat, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence\r\nBut could not,--nay! But needs must suck\r\nAt the great wound, and could not pluck\r\nMy lips away till I had drawn\r\nAll venom out.--Ah, fearful pawn!\r\nFor my omniscience paid I toll\r\nIn infinite remorse of soul.\r\nAll sin was of my sinning, all\r\nAtoning mine, and mine the gall\r\nOf all regret. Mine was the weight\r\nOf every brooded wrong, the hate\r\nThat stood behind each envious thrust,\r\nMine every greed, mine every lust.\r\nAnd all the while for every grief,\r\nEach suffering, I craved relief\r\nWith individual desire,--\r\nCraved all in vain!And felt fierce fire\r\nAbout a thousand people crawl;\r\nPerished with each,--then mourned for all!\r\nA man was starving in Capri;\r\nHe moved his eyes and looked at me;\r\nI felt his gaze, I heard his moan,\r\nAnd knew his hunger as my own.\r\nI saw at sea a great fog bank\r\nBetween two ships that struck and sank;\r\nA thousand screams the heavens smote;\r\nAnd every scream tore through my throat.\r\nNo hurt I did not feel, no death\r\nThat was not mine; mine each last breath\r\nThat, crying, met an answering cry\r\nFrom the compassion that was I.\r\nAll suffering mine, and mine its rod;\r\nMine, pity like the pity of God.\r\nAh, awful weight!Infinity\r\nPressed down upon the finite Me!\r\nMy anguished spirit, like a bird,\r\nBeating against my lips I heard;\r\nYet lay the weight so close about\r\nThere was no room for it without.\r\nAnd so beneath the weight lay I\r\nAnd suffered death, but could not die.\n\r\nLong had I lain thus, craving death,\r\nWhen quietly the earth beneath\r\nGave way, and inch by inch, so great\r\nAt last had grown the crushing weight,\r\nInto the earth I sank till I\r\nFull six feet under ground did lie,\r\nAnd sank no more,--there is no weight\r\nCan follow here, however great.\r\nFrom off my breast I felt it roll,\r\nAnd as it went my tortured soul\r\nBurst forth and fled in such a gust\r\nThat all about me swirled the dust.\n\r\nDeep in the earth I rested now;\r\nCool is its hand upon the brow\r\nAnd soft its breast beneath the head\r\nOf one who is so gladly dead.\r\nAnd all at once, and over all\r\nThe pitying rain began to fall;\r\nI lay and heard each pattering hoof\r\nUpon my lowly, thatched roof,\r\nAnd seemed to love the sound far more\r\nThan ever I had done before.\r\nFor rain it hath a friendly sound\r\nTo one who's six feet underground;\r\nAnd scarce the friendly voice or face:\r\nA grave is such a quiet place.\n\r\nThe rain, I said, is kind to come\r\nAnd speak to me in my new home.\r\nI would I were alive again\r\nTo kiss the fingers of the rain,\r\nTo drink into my eyes the shine\r\nOf every slanting silver line,\r\nTo catch the freshened, fragrant breeze\r\nFrom drenched and dripping apple-trees.\r\nFor soon the shower will be done,\r\nAnd then the broad face of the sun\r\nWill laugh above the rain-soaked earth\r\nUntil the world with answering mirth\r\nShakes joyously, and each round drop\r\nRolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top.\r\nHow can I bear it; buried here,\r\nWhile overhead the sky grows clear\r\nAnd blue again after the storm?\r\nO, multi-colored, multiform,\r\nBeloved beauty over me,\r\nThat I shall never, never see\r\nAgain!Spring-silver, autumn-gold,\r\nThat I shall never more behold!\r\nSleeping your myriad magics through,\r\nClose-sepulchred away from you!\r\nO God, I cried, give me new birth,\r\nAnd put me back upon the earth!\r\nUpset each cloud's gigantic gourd\r\nAnd let the heavy rain, down-poured\r\nIn one big torrent, set me free,\r\nWashing my grave away from me!\n\r\nI ceased; and through the breathless hush\r\nThat answered me, the far-off rush\r\nOf herald wings came whispering\r\nLike music down the vibrant string\r\nOf my ascending prayer, and--crash!\r\nBefore the wild wind's whistling lash\r\nThe startled storm-clouds reared on high\r\nAnd plunged in terror down the sky,\r\nAnd the big rain in one black wave\r\nFell from the sky and struck my grave.\r\nI know not how such things can be;\r\nI only know there came to me\r\nA fragrance such as never clings\r\nTo aught save happy living things;\r\nA sound as of some joyous elf\r\nSinging sweet songs to please himself,\r\nAnd, through and over everything,\r\nA sense of glad awakening.\r\nThe grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,\r\nWhispering to me I could hear;\r\nI felt the rain's cool finger-tips\r\nBrushed tenderly across my lips,\r\nLaid gently on my sealed sight,\r\nAnd all at once the heavy night\r\nFell from my eyes and I could see,--\r\nA drenched and dripping apple-tree,\r\nA last long line of silver rain,\r\nA sky grown clear and blue again.\r\nAnd as I looked a quickening gust\r\nOf wind blew up to me and thrust\r\nInto my face a miracle\r\nOf orchard-breath, and with the smell,--\r\nI know not how such things can be!--\r\nI breathed my soul back into me.\r\nAh!Up then from the ground sprang I\r\nAnd hailed the earth with such a cry\r\nAs is not heard save from a man\r\nWho has been dead, and lives again.\r\nAbout the trees my arms I wound;\r\nLike one gone mad I hugged the ground;\r\nI raised my quivering arms on high;\r\nI laughed and laughed into the sky,\r\nTill at my throat a strangling sob\r\nCaught fiercely, and a great heart-throb\r\nSent instant tears into my eyes;\r\nO God, I cried, no dark disguise\r\nCan e'er hereafter hide from me\r\nThy radiant identity!\r\nThou canst not move across the grass\r\nBut my quick eyes will see Thee pass,\r\nNor speak, however silently,\r\nBut my hushed voice will answer Thee.\r\nI know the path that tells Thy way\r\nThrough the cool eve of every day;\r\nGod, I can push the grass apart\r\nAnd lay my finger on Thy heart!\n\r\nThe world stands out on either side\r\nNo wider than the heart is wide;\r\nAbove the world is stretched the sky,--\r\nNo higher than the soul is high.\r\nThe heart can push the sea and land\r\nFarther away on either hand;\r\nThe soul can split the sky in two,\r\nAnd let the face of God shine through.\r\nBut East and West will pinch the heart\r\nThat can not keep them pushed apart;\r\nAnd he whose soul is flat--the sky\r\nWill cave in on him by and by.",

          "The very best ship that ever I knew,\r\n--Ah-way O, to me O--\r\nWas a big black trawler with a deep-sea crew--\r\nSing, my bullies, let the bullgine run.\n\r\nThere was one old devil with a broken nose\r\n--Ah-way O, to me O--\r\nHe was four score years, as I suppose--\r\nBut, sing, my bullies, let the bullgine run.\n\r\nWe was wrecked last March, in a Polar storm\r\n--Ah-way O, to me O--\r\nAnd we asked the old cripple if his feet was warm--\r\nSing, my bullies, let the bullgine run.\n\r\nAnd the old, old devil (he was ninety at the most)\r\n--Ah-way O, to me O--\r\nRoars, \"Ay, warm as a lickle piece of toast\"--\r\nSo sing, my bullies, let the bullgine run.\n\r\n\"For I soaked my sea-boots and my dungarees\r\n--Ah-way O, to me O--\r\nIn the good salt water that the Lord don't freeze\"--\r\nOh, sing, my bullies, let the bullgine run.",
          "Across the land came a magic word\r\nWhen the earth was bare and lonely,\r\nAnd I sit and sing of the joyous spring,\r\nFor 'twas I who heard, I only!\r\nThen dreams came by, of the gladsome days,\r\nOf many a wayside posy;\r\nFor a crocus peeps where the wild rose sleeps,\r\nAnd the willow wands are rosy!\n\r\nOh! the time to be! When the paths are green,\r\nWhen the primrose-gold is lying\r\n'Neath the hazel spray, where the catkins sway,\r\nAnd the dear south wind comes sighing.\n\r\nMy mate and I, we shall build a nest,\r\nSo snug and warm and cosy,\r\nWhen the kingcups gleam on the meadow stream,\r\nWhere the willow wands are rosy!",
          "If men should rise and return to the noise and time of the tourney,\r\nThe name and fame of the tabard, the tangle of gules and gold,\r\nWould these things stand and suffice for the bourne of a backward journey,\r\nA light on our days returning, as it was in the days of old?\n\r\nNay, there is none rides back to pick up a glove or a feather,\r\nThough the gauntlet rang with honour or the plume was more than a crown:\r\nAnd hushed is the holy trumpet that called the nations together\r\nAnd under the Horns of Hattin the hope of the world went down.\n\r\nAh, not in remembrance stored, but out of oblivion starting,\r\nBecause you have sought new homes and all that you sought is so,\r\nBecause you had trodden the fire and barred the door in departing,\r\nReturns in your chosen exile the glory of long ago.\n\r\nNot then when you barred the door, not then when you trod the embers,\r\nBut now, at your new road's end, you have seen the face of a fate,\r\nThat not as a child looks back, and not as a fool remembers,\r\nAll that men took too lightly and all that they love too late.\n\r\nIt is you that have made no rubric for saints, no raiment for lovers,\r\nYour caps that cry for a feather, your roofs that sigh for a spire:\r\nIs it a dream from the dead if your own decay discovers\r\nAlive in your rotting graveyard the worm of the world's desire?\n\r\nTherefore the old trees tower, that the green trees grow and are stunted:\r\nTherefore these dead men mock you, that you the living are dead:\r\nSince ever you battered the saints and the tools of your crafts were blunted,\r\nOr shattered the glass in its glory and loaded yourselves with the lead.\n\r\nWhen the usurer hunts the squire as the squire has hunted the peasant,\r\nAs sheep that are eaten of worms where men were eaten of sheep:\r\nNow is the judgment of earth, and the weighing of past and present,\r\nWho scorn to weep over ruins, behold your ruin and weep.\n\r\nHave ye not known, ye fools, that have made the present a prison,\r\nThat thirst can remember water and hunger remember bread?\r\nWe went not gathering ghosts; but the shriek of your shame is arisen\r\nOut of your own black Babel too loud; and it woke the dead.\n",
          "You have taken away my cloak,\r\nMy cloak of weariness;\r\nTake my coat also,\r\nMy many-coloured coat of life....\n\r\nOn this great nursery floor\r\nI had three toys,\r\nA bright and varnished vow,\r\nA Speckled Monster, best of boys,\r\nTrue friend to me, and more\r\nBeloved and a thing of cost,\r\nMy doll painted like life; and now\r\nOne is broken and two are lost.\n\r\nFrom the Arabic of John Duncan.",
          "One night in my room, still and beamless,\r\nWith will and with thought in eclipse,\r\nI rested in sleep that was dreamless;\r\nWhen softly there fell on my lips\n\r\nA touch, as of lips that were pressing\r\nMine own with the message of bliss--\r\nA sudden, soft, fleeting caressing,\r\nA breath like a maiden's first kiss.\n\r\nI woke-and the scoffer may doubt me--\r\nI peered in surprise through the gloom;\r\nBut nothing and none were about me,\r\nAnd I was alone in my room.\n\r\nPerhaps 't was the wind that caressed me\r\nAnd touched me with dew-laden breath;\r\nOr, maybe, close-sweeping, there passed me\r\nThe low-winging Angel of Death.\n\r\nSome sceptic may choose to disdain it,\r\nOr one feign to read it aright;\r\nOr wisdom may seek to explain it--\r\nThis mystical kiss in the night.\n\r\nBut rather let fancy thus clear it:\r\nThat, thinking of me here alone,\r\nThe miles were made naught, and, in spirit,\r\nThy lips, love, were laid on mine own.\n",
          "I slumbered with your poems on my breast\r\nSpread open as I dropped them half-read through\r\nLike dove wings on a figure on a tomb\r\nTo see, if in a dream they brought of you,\n\r\nI might not have the chance I missed in life\r\nThrough some delay, and call you to your face\r\nFirst soldier, and then poet, and then both,\r\nWho died a soldier-poet of your race.\n\r\nI meant, you meant, that nothing should remain\r\nUnsaid between us, brother, and this remained \r\nAnd one thing more that was not then to say:\r\nThe Victory for what it lost and gained.\n\r\nYou went to meet the shell's embrace of fire\r\nOn Vimy Ridge; and when you fell that day\r\nThe war seemed over more for you than me,\r\nBut now for me than you the other way.\n\r\nHow over, though, for even me who knew\r\nThe foe thrust back unsafe beyond the Rhine,\r\nIf I was not to speak of it to you\r\nAnd see you pleased once more with words of mine",
          "How many years, how many years have fled,\r\nSince in the cool dim parlour sat the three\r\nLawson and I and, lounging easily,\r\nThe beaming indolent poet! Then instead\r\nOf labouring weary at the mill, we led\r\nThe careless life of wanderers, frank and free,\r\nAnd had the wealth of a new-found world in fee:\r\nHow pitiless time gropes on with tireless tread!\r\nA glass was raised, and golden liquor glowed\r\nWhen a ray from summer streets came piercing in;\r\nHe drank the sunlight in the gloomy place!\r\nAnd now I know the magic drink bestowed\r\nA vital golden splendour on Roderic Quinn,\r\nWhich fumbling fingers of Time will scarce efface.",
          "Alone\r\nI sit in the dusk and see\r\nSurely the living faces, dear to me,\r\nOf comrades who have thrown\r\nAll that they had, the fruit of all desire,\r\nUpon an altar fire.\n\r\nThey heard,\r\nAbove all clamour of the crowd,\r\nThe music of their own hearts throbbing loud\r\nUntil the air was stirred\r\nInto a summoning harmony; and so\r\nWe saw them rise, and go.\n\r\nThe sound,\r\nThat love set ringing in those years\r\nOf agony, exultation, voiceless fears,\r\nAnd hopes now underground,\r\nShall not be silenced; it is thrilling yet,\r\nAnd we shall not forget.\n\r\nBut clear\r\nThe mellow tone of mingled notes,\r\nTriumph and sorrow made one spirit, floats\r\nTo my prophetic ear;\r\nThat is their music echoing, echoing still\r\nFrom our remembering hill.",
          "I grew a rose within a garden fair,\r\nAnd, tending it with more than loving care,\r\nI thought how, with the glory of its bloom,\r\nI should the darkness of my life illume;\r\nAnd, watching, ever smiled to see the lusty bud\r\nDrink freely in the summer sun to tinct its blood.\n\r\nMy rose began to open, and its hue\r\nWas sweet to me as to it sun and dew;\r\nI watched it taking on its ruddy flame\r\nUntil the day of perfect blooming came,\r\nThen hasted I with smiles to find it blushing red--\r\nToo late! Some thoughtless child had plucked my rose and fled!",
          "Darkness had stretched its colour,\r\nDeep blue across the pane:\r\nNo cloud to make night duller,\r\nNo moon with its tarnish stain;\r\nBut only here and there a star,\r\nOne sharp point of frosty fire,\r\nHanging infinitely far\r\nIn mockery of our life and death\r\nAnd all our small desire.\n\r\nNow in this hour of waking\r\nFrom under brows of stone,\r\nA new pale day is breaking\r\nAnd the deep night is gone.\r\nSordid now, and mean and small\r\nThe daylight world is seen again,\r\nWith only the veils of mist that fall\r\nDeaf and muffling over all\r\nTo hide its ugliness and pain.\n\r\nBut to-day this dawn of meanness\r\nShines in my eyes, as when\r\nThe new world's brightness and cleanness\r\nBroke on the first of men.\r\nFor the light that shows the huddled things\r\nOf this close-pressing earth,\r\nShines also on your face and brings\r\nAll its dear beauty back to me\r\nIn a new miracle of birth.\n\r\nI see you asleep and unpassioned,\r\nWhite-faced in the dusk of your hair--\r\nYour beauty so fleetingly fashioned\r\nThat it filled me once with despair\r\nTo look on its exquisite transience\r\nAnd think that our love and thought and laughter\r\nPuff out with the death of our flickering sense,\r\nWhile we pass ever on and away\r\nTowards some blank hereafter.\n\r\nBut now I am happy, knowing\r\nThat swift time is our friend,\r\nAnd that our love's passionate glowing,\r\nThough it turn ash in the end,\r\nIs a rose of fire that must blossom its way\r\nThrough temporal stuff, nor else could be\r\nMore than a nothing. Into day\r\nThe boundless spaces of night contract\r\nAnd in your opening eyes I see\r\nNight born in day, in time eternity.",

So leave me at rest,\r\nIn the west I see a redness come\r\nOver the evening's burning breast -\r\nFor now the pain is numb.\n\r\n The woodbine creeps abroad\r\n Calling low to her lover:\r\nThe sunlit flirt who all the day\r\nHas poised above her lips in play\r\nAnd stolen kisses, shallow and gay\r\nOf dalliance, now has gone away\r\n- She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,\r\n And when above her his broad wings hover\r\n Then her bright breast she will uncover\r\n And yield her honey-drop to her lover.\n\r\n Into the yellow, evening glow\r\n Saunters a man from the farm below,\r\n Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed\r\n Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.\r\nThe bird lies warm against the wall.\r\nShe glances quick her startled eyes\r\nTowards him, then she turns away\r\nHer small head, making warm display\r\nOf red upon the throat. Her terrors sway\r\nHer out of the nest's warm, busy ball,\n\r\nWhose plaintive cries start up as she flies\r\nIn one blue stoop from out the sties\r\nInto the evening's empty hall.\n\r\n Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes\r\n Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,\r\n Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,\r\n Till the distance covers his dangerous tread.\n\r\nThe rabbit presses back her ears,\r\nTurns back her liquid, anguished eyes\r\nAnd crouches low: then with wild spring\r\nSpurts from the terror of the oncoming\r\nTo be choked back, the wire ring\r\nHer frantic effort throttling:\r\nPiteous brown ball of quivering fears!\n\r\nAh soon in his large, hard hands she dies,\r\nAnd swings all loose to the swing of his walk.\r\nYet calm and kindly are his eyes\r\nAnd ready to open in brown surprise\r\nShould I not answer to his talk\r\nOr should he my tears surmise.\n\r\nI hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair\r\nWatching the door open: he flashes bare\r\nHis strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes\r\nIn a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise\r\nHe flings the rabbit soft on the table board\r\nAnd comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword\r\nOf his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad\r\nBlade of his hand that raises my face to applaud\r\nHis coming: he raises up my face to him\r\nAnd caresses my mouth with his fingers, smelling grim\r\nOf the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare\r\nI know not what fine wire is round my throat,\r\nI only know I let him finger there\r\nMy pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat\r\nWho sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:\r\nAnd down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down\r\nHis dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood\r\nUpon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood\r\nOf sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown\r\nWithin him, die, and find death good.",

So idle was my mood;\r\nBut now, before these eyes,\r\nFrom those foul trenches, black with blood,\r\nWhat radiant legions rise!\n\r\nAnd loveliness over the wounded earth awakes\r\nLike wild-flowers in the Spring.\r\nOut of the mortal chrysalis breaks\r\nImmortal wing on wing.\n\r\nThey rise like flowers, they wander on wings of light,\r\nThrough realms beyond our ken.\r\nThe loneliest soul is companied tonight\r\nBy hosts of unknown men.",

Suffice to say\r\nThat, knocking at her wicket,\r\nThere chanced to come one autumn day\r\nA common garden cricket\r\nSo ragged, poor, and needy that,\r\nWithout elucidation,\r\nOne saw the symptoms of a bat\r\nOf several months' duration.\n\r\nHe paused beside her door-step, and,\r\nWith one pathetic gesture,\r\nHe called attention with his hand\r\nTo both his shoes and vesture.\r\n\"I joined,\" said he, \"an opera troupe.\r\nThey suddenly disbanded,\r\nAnd left me on the hostel stoop,\r\nLugubriously stranded.\n\r\n\"I therefore lay aside my pride\r\nAnd frankly ask for clothing.\"\r\n\"Begone!\" the frugal ant replied.\r\n\"I look on you with loathing.\r\nYour muddy shoes have spoiled the lawn,\r\nYour hands have soiled the fence, too.\r\nIf you need money, go and pawn\r\nYour watch--if you have sense to.\"\n\r\nTHE MORAL is: Albeit lots\r\nOf people follow Dr. Watts,\r\nThe sluggard, when his means are scant,\r\nShould seek an uncle, not an ant!",
          "John Kepler, from the chimney corner, watched\r\nHis wife Susannah, with her sleeves rolled back\r\nMaking a salad in a big blue bowl.\r\nThe thick tufts of his black rebellious hair\r\nBrushed into sleek submission; his trim beard\r\nSnug as the soft round body of a thrush\r\nBetween the white wings of his fan-shaped ruff\r\n(His best, with the fine lace border) spoke of guests\r\nExpected; and his quick grey humorous eyes,\r\nHis firm red whimsical pleasure-loving mouth,\r\nAnd all those elvish twinklings of his face,\r\nWere lit with eagerness. Only between his brows,\r\nPerplexed beneath that subtle load of dreams,\r\nTwo delicate shadows brooded.\r\n\"What does it mean?\r\nSir Henry Wotton's letter breathed a hint\r\nThat Italy is prohibiting my book,\"\r\nHe muttered. \"Then, if Austria damns it too,\r\nSusannah mine, we may be forced to choose\r\nBetween the truth and exile. When he comes,\r\nHe'll tell me more. Ambassadors, I suppose,\r\nCan only write in cipher, while our world\r\nIs steered to heaven by murderers and thieves;\r\nBut, if he'd wrapped his friendly warnings up\r\nIn a verse or two, I might have done more work\r\nThese last three days, eh, Sue?\"\r\n \"Look, John,\" said she,\r\n\"What beautiful hearts of lettuce! Tell me now\r\nHow shall I mix it? Will your English guest\r\nTurn up his nose at dandelion leaves\r\nAs crisp and young as these? They've just the tang\r\nOf bitterness in their milk that gives a relish\r\nAnd makes all sweet; and that's philosophy, John.\r\nNow--these spring onions! Would his Excellency\r\nLike sugared rose-leaves better?\"\r\n\"He's a poet,\r\nNot an ambassador only, so I think\r\nHe'll like a cottage salad.\"\r\n \"A poet, John!\r\nI hate their arrogant little insect ways!\r\nI'll put a toadstool in.\"\r\n\"Poets, dear heart,\r\nCan be divided into two clear kinds,--\r\nOne that, by virtue of a half-grown brain,\r\nLives in a silly world of his own making,\r\nA bubble, blown by himself, in which he flits\r\nAnd dizzily bombinates, chanting 'I, I, I,'\r\nFor there is nothing in the heavens above\r\nOr the earth, or hell beneath, but goes to swell\r\nHis personal pronoun. Bring him some dreadful news\r\nHis dearest friend is burned to death,--You'll see\r\nThe monstrous insect strike an attitude\r\nAnd shape himself into one capital I,\r\nA rubric, with red eyes. You'll see him use\r\nThe coffin for his pedestal, hear him mouth\r\nHis 'I, I, I' instructing haggard grief\r\nConcerning his odd ego. Does he chirp\r\nOf love, it's 'I, I, I' Narcissus, love,\r\nMyself, Narcissus, imaged in those eyes;\r\nFor all the love-notes that he sounds are made\r\nAfter the fashion of passionate grasshoppers,\r\nBy grating one hind-leg across another.\r\nNor does he learn to sound that mellower 'You,'\r\nUntil his bubble bursts and leaves him drowned,\r\nAn insect in a soap-sud.\r\nBut there's another kind, whose mind still moves\r\nIn vital concord with the soul of things;\r\nSo that it thinks in music, and its thoughts\r\nPulse into natural song. A separate voice,\r\nAnd yet caught up by the surrounding choirs,\r\nThere, in the harmonies of the Universe,\r\nLosing himself, he saves his soul alive.\"\r\n\"John, I'm afraid!\"--\r\n\"Afraid of what, Susannah?\"--\r\n\"Afraid to put those Ducklings on to roast.\r\nYour friend may miss his road; and, if he's late,\r\nMy little part of the music will be spoiled.\"--\r\n\"He won't, Susannah. Bad poets are always late.\r\nGood poets, at times, delay a note or two;\r\nBut all the great are punctual as the sun.\r\nWhat's that? He's early! That's his knock, I think!\"--\r\n\"The Lord have mercy, John, there's nothing ready!\r\nTake him into your study and talk to him,\r\nTalk hard. He's come an hour before his time;\r\nAnd I've to change my dress. I'll into the kitchen!\"\n\r\nThen, in a moment, all the cottage rang\r\nWith greetings; hand grasped hand; his Excellency\r\nForgot the careful prologue he'd prepared,\r\nAnd made an end of mystery. He had brought\r\nA message from his wisdom-loving king\r\nWho, hearing of new menaces to the light\r\nIn Europe, urged the illustrious Kepler now\r\nTo make his home in England. There, his thought\r\nAnd speech would both be free.\r\n \"My friend,\" said Wotton,\r\n\"I have moved in those old strongholds of the night,\r\nAnd heard strange mutterings. It is not many years\r\nSince Bruno burned. There's trouble brewing too,\r\nFor one you know, I think,--the Florentine\r\nWho made that curious optic tube.\"--\r\n \"You mean\r\nThe man at Padua, Galileo?\"--\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\"They will not dare or need. Proof or disproof\r\nRests with their eyes.\"--\r\n\"Kepler, have you not heard\r\nOf those who, fifteen hundred years ago,\r\nHad eyes and would not see? Eyes quickly close\r\nWhen souls prefer the dark.\"--\r\n\"So be it. Other and younger eyes will see.\r\nPerhaps that's why God gave the young a spice\r\nOf devilry. They'll go look, while elders gasp;\r\nAnd, when the Devil and Truth go hand in hand,\r\nGod help their enemies. You will send my thanks,\r\nMy grateful thanks, Sir Henry, to your king.\r\nTo-day I cannot answer you. I must think.\r\nIt would be very difficult My wife\r\nWould find it hard to leave her native land.\r\nSay nothing yet before her.\"\r\n Then, to hide\r\nTheir secret from Susannah, Kepler poured\r\nHis mind out, and the world's dead branches bloomed.\r\nFor, when he talked, another spring began\r\nTo which our May was winter; and, in the boughs\r\nOf his delicious thoughts, like feathered choirs,\r\nBits of old rhyme, scraps from the Sabine farm,\r\nCelestial phrases from the Shepherd King,\r\nAnd fluttering morsels from Catullus sang.\r\nMuch was fantastic. All was touched with light\r\nThat only genius knows to steal from heaven.\r\nHe spoke of poetry, as the \"flowering time\r\nOf knowledge,\" called it \"thought in passionate tune\r\nWith those great rhythms that steer the moon and sun;\r\nThought in such concord with the soul of things\r\nThat it can only move, like tides and stars,\r\nAnd man's own beating heart, and the wings of birds,\r\nIn law, whose service only sets them free.\"\r\nTherefore it often leaps to the truth we seek,\r\nClasping it, as a lover clasps his bride\r\nIn darkness, ere the sage can light his lamp.\r\nAnd so, in music, men might find the road\r\nTo truth, at many a point, where sages grope.\r\nOne day, a greater Plato would arise\r\nTo write a new philosophy, he said,\r\nShowing how music is the golden clue\r\nTo all the windings of the world's dark maze.\r\nHimself had used it, partly proved it, too,\r\nIn his own book,--the Harmonies of the World.\r\n'All that the years discover points one way\r\nTo this great ordered harmony,\" he said,\r\n\"Revealed on earth by music. Planets move\r\nIn subtle accord like notes of one great song\r\nAudible only to the Artificer,\r\nThe Eternal Artist. There's no grief, no pain,\r\nBut music--follow it simply as a clue,\r\nA microcosmic pattern of the whole--\r\nCan show you, somewhere in its golden scheme,\r\nThe use of all such discords; and, at last,\r\nTheir exquisite solution. Then darkness breaks\r\nInto diviner light, love's agony climbs\r\nThrough death to life, and evil builds up heaven.\r\nHave you not heard, in some great symphony,\r\nThose golden mathematics making clear\r\nThe victory of the soul? Have you not heard\r\nThe very heavens opening?\r\nDo those fools\r\nWho thought me an infidel then, still smile at me\r\nFor trying to read the stars in terms of song,\r\nDiscern their orbits, measure their distances,\r\nBy musical proportions? Let them smile,\r\nMy folly at least revealed those three great laws;\r\nGave me the golden vases of the Egyptians,\r\nTo set in the great new temple of my God\r\nBeyond the bounds of Egypt.\r\nThey will forget\r\nMy methods, doubtless, as the years go by,\r\nAnd the world's wisdom shuts its music out.\r\nThe dust will gather on all my harmonies;\r\nOr scholars turn my pages listlessly,\r\nGlance at the musical phrases, and pass on,\r\nNot troubling even to read one Latin page.\r\nYet they'll accept those great results as mine.\r\nI call them mine. How can I help exulting,\r\nWho climbed my ladder of music to the skies\r\nAnd found, by accident, let them call it so,\r\nOr by the inspiration of that Power\r\nWhich built His world of music, those three laws:--\r\nFirst, how the speed of planets round the sun\r\nBears a proportion, beautifully precise\r\nAs music, to their silver distances;\r\nNext, that although they seem to swerve aside\r\nFrom those plain circles of old Copernicus\r\nTheir paths were not less rhythmical and exact,\r\nBut followed always that most exquisite curve\r\nIn its most perfect form, the pure ellipse;\r\nThird, that although their speed from point to point\r\nAppeared to change, their radii always moved\r\nThrough equal fields of space in equal times.\r\nWas this my infidelity, was this\r\nLess full of beauty, less divine in truth,\r\nThan their dull chaos? You, the poet will know\r\nHow, as those dark perplexities grew clear,\r\nAnd old anomalous discords changed to song,\r\nMy whole soul bowed and cried, Almighty God\r\nThese are Thy thoughts, I am thinking after Thee!\r\nI hope that Tycho knows. I owed so much\r\nTo Tycho Brahe; for it was he who built\r\nThe towers from which I hailed those three great laws.\r\nHow strange and far away it all seems now.\r\nThe thistles grow upon that little isle\r\nWhere Tycho's great Uraniborg once was.\r\nYet, for a few sad years, before it fell\r\nInto decay and ruin, there was one\r\nWho crept about its crumbling corridors,\r\nAnd lit the fire of memory on its hearth.\"--\r\nWotton looked quickly up, \"I think I have heard\r\nSomething of that. You mean poor Jeppe, his dwarf.\r\nFynes Moryson, at the Mermaid Inn one night\r\nShowed a most curious manuscript, a scrawl\r\nOn yellow parchment, crusted here and there\r\nWith sea-salt, or the salt of those thick tears\r\nCreatures like Jeppe, the crooked dwarf, could weep.\r\nIt had been found, clasped in a crooked hand,\r\nUnder the cliffs of Wheen, a crooked hand\r\nThat many a time had beckoned to passing ships,\r\nHoping to find some voyager who would take\r\nA letter to its master.\r\nThe sailors laughed\r\nAnd jeered at him, till Jeppe threw stones at them.\r\nAnd now Jeppe, too, was dead, and one who knew\r\nFynes Moryson, had found him, and brought home\r\nThat curious crooked scrawl. Fynes Englished it\r\nOut of its barbarous Danish. Thus it ran:\r\n'Master, have you forgotten Jeppe, your dwarf,\r\nWho used to lie beside the big log-fire\r\nAnd feed from your own hand? The hall is dark,\r\nThere are no voices now,--only the wind\r\nAnd the sea-gulls crying round Uraniborg.\r\nI too am crying, Master, even I,\r\nBecause there is no fire upon the hearth,\r\nNo light in any window. It is night,\r\nAnd all the faces that I knew are gone.\n\r\nMaster, I watched you leaving us. I saw\r\nThe white sails dwindling into sea-gull's wings,\r\nThen melting into foam, and all was dark.\r\nI lay among the wild flowers on the cliff\r\nAnd dug my nails into the stiff white chalk\r\nAnd called you, Tycho Brahe. You did not hear;\r\nBut gulls and jackdaws, wheeling round my head,\r\nMocked me with Tycho Brahe, and Tycho Brahe!\n\r\nYou were a great magician, Tycho Brahe;\r\nAnd, now that they have driven you away,\r\nI, that am only Jeppe,--the crooked dwarf,\r\nYou used to laugh at for his matted hair,\r\nAnd head too big and heavy--take your pen\r\nHere in your study. I will write it down\r\nAnd send it by a sailor to the King\r\nOf Scotland, and who knows, the mouse that gnawed\r\nThe lion free, may save you, Tycho Brahe.'\"\r\n\"He is free now,\" said Kepler, \"had he lived\r\nHe would have sent for Jeppe to join him there\r\nAt Prague. But death forestalled him, and your King.\r\nThe years in which he watched that planet Mars,\r\nHis patient notes and records, all were mine;\r\nAnd, mark you, had he clipped or trimmed one fact\r\nBy even a hair's-breadth, so that his results\r\nMade a pure circle of that planet's path\r\nIt might have baffled us for an age and drowned\r\nAll our new light in darkness. But he held\r\nTo what he saw. He might so easily,\r\nSo comfortably have said, 'My instruments\r\nAre crude and fallible. In so fine a point\r\nEyes may have erred, too. Why not acquiesce?\r\nWhy mar the tune, why dislocate a world,\r\nFor one slight clash of seeming fact with faith?'\r\nBut no, though stars might swerve, he held his course,\r\nRecording only what his eyes could see\r\nUntil death closed them.\r\n Then, to his results,\r\nI added mine and saw, in one wild gleam,\r\nStrange as the light of day to one born blind,\r\nA subtler concord ruling them and heard\r\nProfounder tones of harmony resolve\r\nThose broken melodies into song again.\"--\r\n\"Faintly and far away, I, too, have seen\r\nIn music, and in verse, that golden clue\r\nWhereof you speak,\" said Wotton. \"In all true song,\r\nThere is a hidden logic. Even the rhyme\r\nThat, in bad poets, wrings the neck of thought,\r\nIs like a subtle calculus to the true,\r\nAn instrument of discovery. It reveals\r\nNew harmonies, new analogies. It links\r\nFar things and near, not in unnatural chains,\r\nBut in those true accords which still escape\r\nThe plodding reason, yet unify the world.\r\nI caught some glimpses of this mystic power\r\nIn verses of your own, that elegy\r\nOn Tycho, and that great quatrain of yours--\r\nI cannot quite recall the Latin words,\r\nBut made it roughly mine in words like these:\n\r\n'I know that I am dust, and daily die;\r\nYet, as I trace those rhythmic spheres at night,\r\nI stand before the Thunderer's throne on high\r\nAnd feast on nectar in the halls of light.'\n\r\nMy version lacks the glory of your lines\r\nBut...\"\r\n\"Mine too was a version,\"\r\nKepler laughed,\r\n\"Turned into Latin from old Ptolemy's Greek;\r\nFor, even in verse, half of the joy, I think,\r\nIs just to pass the torch from hand to hand\r\nAn undimmed splendour. But, last night, I tried\r\nSome music all my own. I had a dream\r\nThat I was wandering in some distant world.\r\nI have often dreamed it Once it was the moon.\r\nI wrote that down in prose. When I am dead,\r\nIt may be printed. This was a fairer dream:\r\nFor I was walking in a far-off spring\r\nUpon the planet, Venus. Only verse\r\nCould spread true wings for that delicious world;\r\nAnd so I wrote it--for no eyes but mine,\r\nOr 'twould be seized on, doubtless, as fresh proof\r\nOf poor old Kepler's madness.\"--\r\n \"Let me hear,\r\nMadman to madman; for I, too, write verse.\"\r\nThen Kepler, in a rhythmic murmur, breathed\r\nHis rich enchanted memories of that dream:\n\r\n\"Beauty burned before me\r\n Swinging a lanthorn through that fragrant night.\r\n I followed a distant singing,\r\n And a dreaming light\r\n How she led me, I cannot tell\r\n To that strange world afar,\r\n Nor how I walked, in that wild glen\r\n Upon the sunset star.\n\r\n Winged creatures floated\r\n Under those rose-red boughs of violet bloom,\r\n With delicate forms unknown on Earth\r\n 'Twixt irised plume and plume;\r\n Human-hearted, angel-eyed,\r\n And crowned with unknown flowers;\r\n For nothing in that enchanted world\r\n Followed the way of ours.\n\r\n Only I saw that Beauty,\r\n On Hesper, as on earth, still held command;\r\n And though, as one in slumber,\r\n I roamed that radiant land,\r\n With all these earth-born senses sealed\r\n To what the Hesperians knew,\r\n The faithful lanthorn of her law\r\n Was mine on Hesper too.\n\r\n Then, half at home with wonder,\r\n I saw strange flocks of flowers like birds take flight;\r\n Great trees that burned like opals\r\n To lure their loves at night;\r\n Dark beings that could move in realms\r\n No dream of ours has known.\r\n Till these became as common things\r\n As men account their own.\n\r\n Yet, when that lanthorn led me\r\n Back to the world where once I thought me wise;\r\n I saw, on this my planet,\r\n What souls, with awful eyes.\r\n Hardly I dared to walk her fields\r\n As in that strange re-birth\r\n I looked on those wild miracles\r\n The birds and flowers of earth.\"\n\r\nSilence a moment held them, loth to break\r\nThe spell of that strange dream,\r\n \"One proof the more\"\r\nSaid Wotton at last, \"that songs can mount and fly\r\nTo truth; for this fantastic vision of yours\r\nOf life in other spheres, awakes in me,\r\nEither that slumbering knowledge of Socrates,\r\nOr some strange premonition that the years\r\nWill prove it true. This music leads us far\r\nFrom all our creeds, except that faith in law.\r\nYour quest for knowledge--how it rests on that!\r\nHow sure the soul is that if truth destroy\r\nThe temple, in three days the truth will build\r\nA nobler temple; and that order reigns\r\nIn all things. Even your atheist builds his doubt\r\nOn that strange faith; destroys his heaven and God\r\nIn absolute faith that his own thought is true\r\nTo law, God's lanthorn to our stumbling feet;\r\nAnd so, despite himself, he worships God,\r\nFor where true souls are, there are God and heaven.\"--\n\r\n\"It is an ancient wisdom. Long ago,\"\r\nSaid Kepler, \"under the glittering Eastern sky,\r\nThe shepherd king looked up at those great stars,\r\nThose ordered hosts, and cried Caeli narrant\r\nGloriam Dei!\r\n Though there be some to-day\r\nWho'd ape Lucretius, and believe themselves\r\nEpicureans, little they know of him\r\nWho, even in utter darkness, bowed his head,\r\nTo something nobler than the gods of Rome\r\nReigning beyond the darkness.\r\nThey accept\r\nThe law, the music of these ordered worlds;\r\nAnd straight deny the law's first postulate,\r\nThat out of nothingness nothing can be born,\r\nNor greater things from less. Can music rise\r\nBy chance from chaos, as they said that star\r\nIn Serpentarius rose? I told them, then,\r\nThat when I was a boy, with time to spare,\r\nI played at anagrams. Out of my Latin name\r\nJohannes Keplerus came that sinister phrase\r\nSerpens in akuleo. Struck by this,\r\nI tried again, but trusted it to chance.\r\nI took some playing cards, and wrote on each\r\nOne letter of my name. Then I began\r\nTo shuffle them; and, at every shuffle, I read\r\nThe letters, in their order, as they came,\r\nTo see what meaning chance might give to them.\r\nWotton, the gods and goddesses must have laughed\r\nTo see the weeks I lost in studying chance;\r\nFor had I scattered those cards into the black\r\nEpicurean eternity, I'll swear\r\nThey'd still be playing at leap-frog in the dark,\r\nAnd show no glimmer of sense. And yet--to hear\r\nThose wittols talk, you'd think you'd but to mix\r\nA bushel of good Greek letters in a sack\r\nAnd shake them roundly for an age or so,\r\nTo pour the Odyssey out.\r\n At last, I told,\r\nThose disputants what my wife had said. One night\r\nWhen I was tired and all my mind a-dust\r\nWith pondering on their atoms, I was called\r\nTo supper, and she placed before me there\r\nA most delicious salad. 'It would appear,'\r\nI thought aloud, 'that if these pewter dishes,\r\nGreen hearts of lettuce, tarragon, slips of thyme,\r\nSlices of hard boiled egg, and grains of salt.\r\nWith drops of water, vinegar and oil,\r\nHad in a bottomless gulf been flying about\r\nFrom all eternity, one sure certain day\r\nThe sweet invisible hand of Happy Chance\r\nWould serve them as a salad.'\r\n'Likely enough,'\r\nMy wife replied, 'but not so good as mine,\r\nNor so well dressed.'\"\r\n They laughed. Susannah's voice\r\nBroke in, \"I've made a better one. The receipt\r\nCame from the Golden Lion. I have dished\r\nDucklings and peas and all. Come, John, say grace.\"",
          "The Master of the Garden said;\r\n\"Who, now the Earth seems cold and dead,\r\nWill by his fearless witnessing\r\nHold men's hearts for the tardy spring?\"\n\r\n\"Not yet. I am but half awake,\"\r\nAll drowsily the Primrose spake.\r\nAnd fast the sleeping Daffodils\r\nHad folded up their golden frills.\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" the frail Anemone\r\nSaid softly, \"'tis too cold for me.\"\r\nWood Hyacinths, all deeply set,\r\nReplied: \"No ice has melted yet.\"\n\r\nWhen suddenly, with smile so bright,\r\nUp sprang a Winter Aconite,\r\nAnd to the Master joyfully\r\nShe cried: \"I will the witness be.\"",

          "Thinking of these, of beautiful brief things,\r\nOf things that are of sense and spirit made,\r\nOf meadow flowers, dense hedges and dark bushes\r\nWith roses trailing over nests of thrushes;\n\r\nOf dews so pure and bright and flush'd and cool,\r\nAnd like the flowers as brief as beautiful;\r\nThinking of the tall grass and daisies tall\r\nAnd whispered music of the waving bents;\n\r\nOf these that like a simple child I love\r\nSince they are life and life is flowers and grass;\r\nThinking of trees, and water at their feet\r\nAnswering the trees with murmur childlike sweet;\n\r\nThinking of those high thoughts that passed like the wind\r\nYet left their brightness lying on the mind,\r\nAs the white blossoms the raw airs shake down\r\nThat lie awhile yet lovely on the chill grass;\n\r\nThinking of the dark, where all these end like cloud,\r\nAnd the stars watch like Knights to Honour vowed,\r\nOf those too lovely colours of the East,\r\nAnd the too tender loveliness of grey:\n\r\nThinking of all, I was as one that stands\r\n'Neath the bewildering shock of breaking seas;\r\nMortal-immortal things had lost their power,\r\nI knew no more than sweetness in the flower;\n\r\nNo more than colour in the changing light,\r\nNo more than order in the stars of night;\r\nA breathing tree was but gaunt wood and leaves;\r\nAll these had lost their old power over me.\n\r\nI had forgotten that ever such things were:\r\nImmortal-mortal, I had been but blind ...\r\nO the wild sweetness of the renewing sense\r\nThat swept me and drove all but sweetness hence!\n\r\n... As beautiful as brief--ah! lovelier,\r\nBeing but mortal. Yet I had great fear--\r\nThat I should die ere these sweet things were dead,\r\nOr live on knowing the wild sweetness fled.\n",
          "Slowly, silently, now the moon\r\nWalks the night in her silver shoon:\r\nThis way, and that, she peers and sees\r\nSilver fruit upon silver trees;\r\nOne by one the casements catch\r\nHer beams beneath the silvery thatch;\r\nCouched in his kennel, like a log,\r\nWith paws of silver sleeps the dog\r\nFrom their shadowy cote the white breasts peep\r\nOf doves in a silver-feathered sleep;\r\nA harvest mouse goes scampering by,\r\nWith silver claws and silver eye;\r\nAnd moveless fish in the water gleam\r\nBy silver reeds in a silver stream.",
          "Nothing on the grey roof, nothing on the brown,\r\nOnly a little greening where the rain drips down;\r\nNobody at the window, nobody at the door,\r\nOnly a little hollow which a foot once wore;\r\nBut still I tread on tiptoe, still tiptoe on I go,\r\nPast nettles, porch, and weedy well, for oh, I know\r\nA friendless face is peering, and a still clear eye\r\nPeeps closely through the casement\r\n as my step goes by.",
          "Oft as by chance, a little while apart\r\nThe pall of empty, loveless hours withdrawn,\r\nSweet Beauty, opening on the impoverished heart,\r\nBeams like the jewel on the breast of dawn:\r\nNot though high heaven should rend would deeper awe\r\nFill me than penetrates my spirit thus,\r\nNor all those signs the Patmian prophet saw\r\nSeem a new heaven and earth so marvelous;\r\nBut, clad thenceforth in iridescent dyes,\r\nThe fair world glistens, and in after days\r\nThe memory of kind lips and laughing eyes\r\nLives in my step and lightens all my face, - \r\nSo they who found the Earthly Paradise\r\nStill breathed, returned, of that sweet, joyful place.",
          "As I walk the misty hill\r\nAll is languid, fogged, and still;\r\nNot a note of any bird\r\nNor any motion's hint is heard,\r\nSave from soaking thickets round\r\nTrickle or water's rushing sound,\r\nAnd from ghostly trees the drip\r\nOf runnel dews or whispering slip\r\nOf leaves, which in a body launch\r\nListlessly from the stagnant branch\r\nTo strew the marl, already strown,\r\nWith litter sodden as its own,\n\r\nA rheum, like blight, hangs on the briars,\r\nAnd from the clammy ground suspires\r\nA sweet frail sick autumnal scent\r\nOf stale frost furring weeds long spent;\r\nAnd wafted on, like one who sleeps,\r\nA feeble vapour hangs or creeps,\r\nExhaling on the fungus mould\r\nA breath of age, fatigue, and cold.\n\r\nOozed from the bracken's desolate track,\r\nBy dark rains havocked and drenched black.\r\nA fog about the coppice drifts,\r\nOr slowly thickens up and lifts\r\nInto the moist, despondent air.\n\r\nMist, grief, and stillness everywhere....\n\r\nAnd in me, too, there is no sound\r\nSave welling as of tears profound,\r\nWhere in me cloud, grief, stillness reign,\r\nAnd an intolerable pain\r\nBegins.\r\nRolled on as in a flood there come\r\nMemories of childhood, boyhood, home,\r\nAnd that which, sudden, pangs me most,\r\nThought of the first-belov'd, long lost,\r\nToo easy lost! My cold lips frame\r\nTremulously the familiar name,\r\nUnheard of her upon my breath:\r\n'Elizabeth. Elizabeth.'\n\r\nNo voice answers on the hill,\r\nAll is shrouded, sad, and still ...\r\nStillness, fogged brakes, and fog on high.\r\nOnly in me the waters cry\r\nWho mourn the hours now slipped for ever,\r\nHours of boding, joy, and fever,\r\nWhen we loved, by chance beguiled,\r\nI a boy and you a child, \r\nChild! but with an angel's air,\r\nAstonished, eager, unaware,\r\nOr elfin's, wandering with a grace\r\nForeign to any fireside race,\r\nAnd with a gaiety unknown\r\nIn the light feet and hair backblown,\r\nAnd with a sadness yet more strange,\r\nIn meagre cheeks which knew to change\r\nOr faint or fired more swift than sight,\r\nAnd forlorn hands and lips pressed white,\r\nAnd fragile voice, and head downcast,\r\nHiding tears, lifted at the last\r\nTo speed with one pale smile the wise\r\nGlance of the grey immortal eyes.\n\r\nHow strange it was that we should dare\r\nCompound a miracle so rare\r\nAs, 'twixt this pace and Time's next pace,\r\nEach to discern th' elected's face!\r\nYet stranger that the high sweet fire,\r\nIn hearts nigh foreign to desire,\r\nCould burn, sigh, weep, and burn again\r\nAs oh, it never has since then!\r\nMost strange of all that we so young\r\nDared learn but would not speak love's tongue,\r\nLove pledged but in the reveries\r\nOf our sad and dreaming eyes....\n\r\nNow upon such journey bound me,\r\nGrief, disquiet, and stillness round me,\r\nAs bids me where I cannot tell,\r\nTurn I and sigh, unseen, farewell.\r\nBreathe the name as soft as mist,\r\nLips, which nor kissed her nor were kissed!\r\nAnd again, a sigh, a death, \r\n'Elizabeth. Elizabeth.'\n\r\nNo voice answers; but the mist\r\nGlows for a moment amethyst\r\nEre the hid sun dissolves away,\r\nAnd dimness, growing dimmer grey,\r\nHides all ... till nothing can I see\r\nBut the blind walls enclosing me,\r\nAnd no sound and no motion hear\r\nBut the vague water throbbing near,\r\nSole voice upon the darkening hill\r\nWhere all is blank and dead and still.\n",
          "Still bathed in its moonlight slumber, the little white house by the cedar\r\nStands silent against the red dawn;\r\nAnd nothing I know of who sleeps there, to the travail of day yet unwakened,\r\nBehind the blue curtains undrawn:\n\r\nBut I dream as we march down the roadway, ringing loud and white-rimed in the moonlight,\r\nOf a little dark house on a hill\r\nWherein when the battle is over, to the rapture of day yet unwakened,\r\nWe shall slumber as dreamless and still.",

A few gripped stones.\r\nAnd there, his back against the battered door,\r\nHis pile of books scattered about his feet,\r\nStood Shelley while two others held him fast,\r\nAnd the clods beat upon him. `Shelley! Shelley!'\r\nThe high shouts rang through all the corridors,\r\n`Shelley! Mad Shelley! Come along and help!'\r\nAnd all the crowd dug madly at the earth,\r\nScratching and clawing at the streaming mud,\r\nAnd fouled each other and themselves. And still\r\nShelley stood up. His eyes were like a flame\r\nSet in some white, still room; for all his face\r\nWas white, a whiteness like no human color,\r\nBut white and dreadful as consuming fire.\r\nHis hands shook now and then, like slender cords\r\nWhich bear too heavy weights. He did not speak.\r\nSo I saw Shelley plain.\"\r\n \"And you?\" I said.\n\r\n\"I? I threw straighter than the most of them,\r\nAnd had firm clods. I hit him -- well, at least\r\nThrice in the face.

I do not think\r\nThey'd understand. Jocelyn might, perhaps;\r\nAnd Dick, if only they were left alone.\r\nBut Rosalind never; nor that nephew of mine,\r\nThe witty politician. No. No. No.\r\nThey'd say my mind was wandering, I'm afraid.\"\r\nSo, with a frozen face, reluctantly,\r\nHe tossed his verses into the dying fire,\r\nAnd watched the sparks fly upward.\r\n There, at dawn,\r\nThey found him, cold and stiff by the cold hearth,\r\nHis amber snuff-box in his ivory hand.\r\n\"You see,\" they said, \"he never needed friends.\r\nHe had that curious antique frozen way.\r\nHe had no heart--only an amber snuff-box.\r\nHe died quite happily, taking a pinch of snuff.\"\n\r\nHis nephew, that engaging politician,\r\nInherited the snuff-box, and remarked\r\nHis epitaph should be \"Snuffed Out.\" The clubs\r\nLaughed, and the statesman's reputation grew.",

He's awful!\r\nI never saw a man let family troubles\r\nMake so much difference in his man's affairs.\r\nHe's just dropped everything. He's like a child.\r\nI blame his being brought up by his mother.\r\nHe's got hay down that's been rained on three times.\r\nHe hoed a little yesterday for me:\r\nI thought the growing things would do him good.\r\nSomething went wrong. I saw him throw the hoe\r\nSky-high with both hands. I can see it now \r\nCome here I'll show you in that apple tree.\r\nThat's no way for a man to do at his age:\r\nHe's fifty-five, you know, if he's a day.\"\r\n\"Aren't you afraid of him? What's that gun for?\"\r\n\"Oh, that's been there for hawks since chicken-time.\r\nJohn Hall touch me! Not if he knows his friends.\r\nI'll say that for him, John's no threatener\r\nLike some men folk. No one's afraid of him;\r\nAll is, he's made up his mind not to stand\r\nWhat he has got to stand.\"\r\n\"Where is Estelle?\r\nCouldn't one talk to her? What does she say?\r\nYou say you don't know where she is.\"\r\n\"Nor want to!\r\nShe thinks if it was bad to live with him,\r\nIt must be right to leave him.\"\r\n\"Which is wrong!\"\r\n\"Yes, but he should have married her.\"\r\n\"I know.\"\r\n\"The strain's been too much for her all these years:\r\nI can't explain it any other way.\r\nIt's different with a man, at least with John:\r\nHe knows he's kinder than the run of men.\r\nBetter than married ought to be as good\r\nAs married that's what he has always said.\r\nI know the way he's felt but all the same!\"\r\n\"I wonder why he doesn't marry her\r\nAnd end it.\"\r\n\"Too late now: she wouldn't have him.\r\nHe's given her time to think of something else.\r\nThat's his mistake. The dear knows my interest\r\nHas been to keep the thing from breaking up.\r\nThis is a good home: I don't ask for better.\r\nBut when I've said, 'Why shouldn't they be married,'\r\nHe'd say, 'Why should they?' no more words than that.\"\r\n\"And after all why should they? John's been fair\r\nI take it. What was his was always hers.\r\nThere was no quarrel about property.\"\r\n\"Reason enough, there was no property.\r\nA friend or two as good as own the farm,\r\nSuch as it is. It isn't worth the mortgage.\"\r\n\"I mean Estelle has always held the purse.\"\r\n\"The rights of that are harder to get at.\r\nI guess Estelle and I have filled the purse.\r\n'Twas we let him have money, not he us.\r\nJohn's a bad farmer. I'm not blaming him.\r\nTake it year in, year out, he doesn't make much.\r\nWe came here for a home for me, you know,\r\nEstelle to do the housework for the board\r\nOf both of us. But look how it turns out:\r\nShe seems to have the housework, and besides,\r\nHalf of the outdoor work, though as for that,\r\nHe'd say she does it more because she likes it.\r\nYou see our pretty things are all outdoors.\r\nOur hens and cows and pigs are always better\r\nThan folks like us have any business with.\r\nFarmers around twice as well off as we\r\nHaven't as good. They don't go with the farm.\r\nOne thing you can't help liking about John,\r\nHe's fond of nice things too fond, some would say.\r\nBut Estelle don't complain: she's like him there.\r\nShe wants our hens to be the best there are.\r\nYou never saw this room before a show,\r\nFull of lank, shivery, half-drowned birds\r\nIn separate coops, having their plumage done.\r\nThe smell of the wet feathers in the heat!\r\nYou spoke of John's not being safe to stay with.\r\nYou don't know what a gentle lot we are:\r\nWe wouldn't hurt a hen! You ought to see us\r\nMoving a flock of hens from place to place.\r\nWe're not allowed to take them upside down,\r\nAll we can hold together by the legs.\r\nTwo at a time's the rule, one on each arm,\r\nNo matter how far and how many times\r\nWe have to go.\"\r\n\"You mean that's John's idea.\"\r\n\"And we live up to it; or I don't know\r\nWhat childishness he wouldn't give way to.\r\nHe manages to keep the upper hand\r\nOn his own farm. He's boss. But as to hens:\r\nWe fence our flowers in and the hens range.\r\nNothing's too good for them. We say it pays.\r\nJohn likes to tell the offers he has had,\r\nTwenty for this cock, twenty-five for that.\r\nHe never takes the money. If they're worth\r\nThat much to sell, they're worth as much to keep.\r\nBless you, it's all expense, though. Reach me down\r\nThe little tin box on the cupboard shelf,\r\nThe upper shelf, the tin box. That's the one.\r\nI'll show you. Here you are.\"\r\n\"What's this?\"\r\n\"A bill \r\nFor fifty dollars for one Langshang cock \r\nReceipted. And the cock is in the yard.\"\r\n\"Not in a glass case, then?\"\r\n\"He'd need a tall one:\r\nHe can eat off a barrel from the ground.\r\nHe's been in a glass case, as you may say,\r\nThe Crystal Palace, London. He's imported.\r\nJohn bought him, and we paid the bill with beads \r\nWampum, I call it. Mind, we don't complain.\r\nBut you see, don't you, we take care of him.\"\r\n\"And like it, too. It makes it all the worse.\"\r\n\"It seems as if. And that's not all: he's helpless\r\nIn ways that I can hardly tell you of.\r\nSometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts\r\nTo see where all the money goes so fast.\r\nYou know how men will be ridiculous.\r\nBut it's just fun the way he gets bedeviled \r\nIf he's untidy now, what will he be?\r\n\"It makes it all the worse. You must be blind.\"\r\n\"Estelle's the one. You needn't talk to me.\"\r\n\"Can't you and I get to the root of it?\r\nWhat's the real trouble? What will satisfy her?\"\r\n\"It's as I say: she's turned from him, that's all.\"\r\n\"But why, when she's well off? Is it the neighbours,\r\nBeing cut off from friends?\"\r\n\"We have our friends.\r\nThat isn't it. Folks aren't afraid of us.\"\r\n\"She's let it worry her. You stood the strain,\r\nAnd you're her mother.\"\r\n\"But I didn't always.\r\nI didn't relish it along at first.\r\nBut I got wonted to it. And besides \r\nJohn said I was too old to have grandchildren.\r\nBut what's the use of talking when it's done?\r\nShe won't come back it's worse than that she can't.\"\r\n\"Why do you speak like that? What do you know?\r\nWhat do you mean? she's done harm to herself?\"\r\n\"I mean she's married married someone else.\"\r\n\"Oho, oho!\"\r\n\"You don't believe me.\"\r\n\"Yes, I do,\r\nOnly too well. I knew there must be something!\r\nSo that was what was back. She's bad, that's all!\"\r\n\"Bad to get married when she had the chance?\"\r\n\"Nonsense! See what's she done! But who, who\"\r\n\"Who'd marry her straight out of such a mess?\r\nSay it right out no matter for her mother.\r\nThe man was found. I'd better name no names.\r\nJohn himself won't imagine who he is.\"\r\n\"Then it's all up. I think I'll get away.\r\nYou'll be expecting John. I pity Estelle;\r\nI suppose she deserves some pity, too.\r\nYou ought to have the kitchen to yourself\r\nTo break it to him. You may have the job.\"\r\n\"You needn't think you're going to get away.\r\nJohn's almost here. I've had my eye on someone\r\nComing down Ryan's Hill. I thought 'twas him.\r\nHere he is now. This box! Put it away.\r\nAnd this bill.\"\r\n\"What's the hurry? He'll unhitch.\"\r\n\"No, he won't, either. He'll just drop the reins\r\nAnd turn Doll out to pasture, rig and all.\r\nShe won't get far before the wheels hang up\r\nOn something there's no harm. See, there he is!\r\nMy, but he looks as if he must have heard!\"\r\nJohn threw the door wide but he didn't enter.\r\n\"How are you, neighbour? Just the man I'm after.\r\nIsn't it Hell,\" he said. \"I want to know.\r\nCome out here if you want to hear me talk.\r\nI'll talk to you, old woman, afterward.\r\nI've got some news that maybe isn't news.\r\nWhat are they trying to do to me, these two?\"\r\n\"Do go along with him and stop his shouting.\"\r\nShe raised her voice against the closing door:\r\n\"Who wants to hear your news, you dreadful fool?\"",
          " I'm dead.\r\n Officially I'm dead. Their hope is past.\r\n How long I stood as missing! Now, at last\r\n I'm dead.\r\n Look in my face - no likeness can you see,\r\n No tiny trace of him they knew as \"me\".\r\n How terrible the change!\r\n Even my eyes are strange.\r\n So keyed are they to pain,\r\n That if I chanced to meet\r\n My mother in the street\r\n She'd look at me in vain.\n\r\n When she got home I think she'd say:\r\n \"I saw the saddest sight to-day - \r\n A poilu with no face at all.\r\n Far better in the fight to fall\r\n Than go through life like that, I think.\r\n Poor fellow! how he made me shrink.\r\n No face. Just eyes that seemed to stare\r\n At me with anguish and despair.\r\n This ghastly war! I'm almost cheered\r\n To think my son who disappeared,\r\n My boy so handsome and so gay,\r\n Might have come home like him to-day.\"\n\r\n I'm dead. I think it's better to be dead\r\n When little children look at you with dread;\r\n And when you know your coming home again\r\n Will only give the ones who love you pain.\r\n Ah! who can help but shrink? One cannot blame.\r\n They see the hideous husk, not, not the flame\r\n Of sacrifice and love that burns within;\r\n While souls of satyrs, riddled through with sin,\r\n Have bodies fair and excellent to see.\r\n Mon Dieu! how different we all would be\r\n If this our flesh was ordained to express\r\n Our spirit's beauty or its ugliness.\n\r\n (Oh, you who look at me with fear to-day,\r\n And shrink despite yourselves, and turn away - \r\n It was for you I suffered woe accurst;\r\n For you I braved red battle at its worst;\r\n For you I fought and bled and maimed and slew;\r\n For you, for you!\r\n For you I faced hell-fury and despair;\r\n The reeking horror of it all I knew:\r\n I flung myself into the furnace there;\r\n I faced the flame that scorched me with its glare;\r\n I drank unto the dregs the devil's brew - \r\n Look at me now - for you and you and you. . . .)\n\r\n .....\n\r\n I'm thinking of the time we said good-by:\r\n We took our dinner in Duval's that night,\r\n Just little Jacqueline, Lucette and I;\r\n We tried our very utmost to be bright.\r\n We laughed. And yet our eyes, they weren't gay.\r\n I sought all kinds of cheering things to say.\r\n \"Don't grieve,\" I told them. \"Soon the time will pass;\r\n My next permission will come quickly round;\r\n We'll all meet at the Gare du Montparnasse;\r\n Three times I've come already, safe and sound.\"\r\n (But oh, I thought, it's harder every time,\r\n After a home that seems like Paradise,\r\n To go back to the vermin and the slime,\r\n The weariness, the want, the sacrifice.\r\n \"Pray God,\" I said, \"the war may soon be done,\r\n But no, oh never, never till we've won!\")\n\r\n Then to the station quietly we walked;\r\n I had my rifle and my haversack,\r\n My heavy boots, my blankets on my back;\r\n And though it hurt us, cheerfully we talked.\r\n We chatted bravely at the platform gate.\r\n I watched the clock. My train must go at eight.\r\n One minute to the hour . . . we kissed good-by,\r\n Then, oh, they both broke down, with piteous cry.\r\n I went. . . . Their way was barred; they could not pass.\r\n I looked back as the train began to start;\r\n Once more I ran with anguish at my heart\r\n And through the bars I kissed my little lass. . . .\n\r\n Three years have gone; they've waited day by day.\r\n I never came. I did not even write.\r\n For when I saw my face was such a sight\r\n I thought that I had better . . . stay away.\r\n And so I took the name of one who died,\r\n A friendless friend who perished by my side.\r\n In Prussian prison camps three years of hell\r\n I kept my secret; oh, I kept it well!\r\n And now I'm free, but none shall ever know;\r\n They think I died out there . . . it's better so.\n\r\n To-day I passed my wife in widow's weeds.\r\n I brushed her arm. She did not even look.\r\n So white, so pinched her face, my heart still bleeds,\r\n And at the touch of her, oh, how I shook!\r\n And then last night I passed the window where\r\n They sat together; I could see them clear,\r\n The lamplight softly gleaming on their hair,\r\n And all the room so full of cozy cheer.\r\n My wife was sewing, while my daughter read;\r\n I even saw my portrait on the wall.\r\n I wanted to rush in, to tell them all;\r\n And then I cursed myself: \"You're dead, you're dead!\"\r\n God! how I watched them from the darkness there,\r\n Clutching the dripping branches of a tree,\r\n Peering as close as ever I might dare,\r\n And sobbing, sobbing, oh, so bitterly!\n\r\n But no, it's folly; and I mustn't stay.\r\n To-morrow I am going far away.\r\n I'll find a ship and sail before the mast;\r\n In some wild land I'll bury all the past.\r\n I'll live on lonely shores and there forget,\r\n Or tell myself that there has never been\r\n The gay and tender courage of Lucette,\r\n The little loving arms of Jacqueline.\n\r\n A man lonely upon a lonely isle,\r\n Sometimes I'll look towards the North and smile\r\n To think they're happy, and they both believe\r\n I died for France, and that I lie at rest;\r\n And for my glory's sake they've ceased to grieve,\r\n And hold my memory sacred. Ah! that's best.\r\n And in that thought I'll find my joy and peace\r\n As there alone I wait the Last Release.",

          "A chant to which it is intended a group of children shall dance and improvise pantomime led by their dancing-teacher.\n\n\r\n I\n\r\n A master deep-eyed\r\n Ere his manhood was ripe,\r\n He sang like a thrush,\r\n He could play any pipe.\r\n So dull in the school\r\n That he scarcely could spell,\r\n He read but a bit,\r\n And he figured not well.\r\n A bare-footed fool,\r\n Shod only with grace;\r\n Long hair streaming down\r\n Round a wind-hardened face;\r\n He smiled like a girl,\r\n Or like clear winter skies,\r\n A virginal light\r\n Making stars of his eyes.\r\n In swiftness and poise,\r\n A proud child of the deer,\r\n A white fawn he was,\r\n Yet a fawn without fear.\r\n No youth thought him vain,\r\n Or made mock of his hair,\r\n Or laughed when his ways\r\n Were most curiously fair.\r\n A mastiff at fight,\r\n He could strike to the earth\r\n The envious one\r\n Who would challenge his worth.\r\n However we bowed\r\n To the schoolmaster mild,\r\n Our spirits went out\r\n To the fawn-footed child.\r\n His beckoning led\r\n Our troop to the brush.\r\n We found nothing there\r\n But a wind and a hush.\r\n He sat by a stone\r\n And he looked on the ground,\r\n As if in the weeds\r\n There was something profound.\r\n His pipe seemed to neigh,\r\n Then to bleat like a sheep,\r\n Then sound like a stream\r\n Or a waterfall deep.\r\n It whispered strange tales,\r\n Human words it spoke not.\r\n Told fair things to come,\r\n And our marvellous lot\r\n If now with fawn-steps\r\n Unshod we advanced\r\n To the midst of the grove\r\n And in reverence danced.\r\n We obeyed as he piped\r\n Soft grass to young feet,\r\n Was a medicine mighty,\r\n A remedy meet.\r\n Our thin blood awoke,\r\n It grew dizzy and wild,\r\n Though scarcely a word\r\n Moved the lips of a child.\r\n Our dance gave allegiance,\r\n It set us apart,\r\n We tripped a strange measure,\r\n Uplifted of heart.\n\n\r\n II\n\r\n We thought to be proud\r\n Of our fawn everywhere.\r\n We could hardly see how\r\n Simple books were a care.\r\n No rule of the school\r\n This strange student could tame.\r\n He was banished one day,\r\n While we quivered with shame.\r\n He piped back our love\r\n On a moon-silvered night,\r\n Enticed us once more\r\n To the place of delight.\r\n A greeting he sang\r\n And it made our blood beat,\r\n It tramped upon custom\r\n And mocked at defeat.\r\n He builded a fire\r\n And we tripped in a ring,\r\n The embers our books\r\n And the fawn our good king.\r\n And now we approached\r\n All the mysteries rare\r\n That shadowed his eyelids\r\n And blew through his hair.\r\n That spell now was peace\r\n The deep strength of the trees,\r\n The children of nature\r\n We clambered her knees.\r\n Our breath and our moods\r\n Were in tune with her own,\r\n Tremendous her presence,\r\n Eternal her throne.\r\n The ostracized child\r\n Our white foreheads kissed,\r\n Our bodies and souls\r\n Became lighter than mist.\r\n Sweet dresses like snow\r\n Our small lady-loves wore,\r\n Like moonlight the thoughts\r\n That our bosoms upbore.\r\n Like a lily the touch\r\n Of each cold little hand.\r\n The loves of the stars\r\n We could now understand.\r\n O quivering air!\r\n O the crystalline night!\r\n O pauses of awe\r\n And the faces swan-white!\r\n O ferns in the dusk!\r\n O forest-shrined hour!\r\n O earth that sent upward\r\n The thrill and the power,\r\n To lift us like leaves,\r\n A delirious whirl,\r\n The masterful boy\r\n And the delicate girl!\r\n What child that strange night-time\r\n Can ever forget?\r\n His fealty due\r\n And his infinite debt\r\n To the folly divine,\r\n To the exquisite rule\r\n Of the perilous master,\r\n The fawn-footed fool?\n\n\r\n III\n\r\n Now soldiers we seem,\r\n And night brings a new thing,\r\n A terrible ire,\r\n As of thunder awing.\r\n A warrior power,\r\n That old chivalry stirred,\r\n When knights took up arms,\r\n As the maidens gave word.\r\n THE END OF OUR WAR,\r\n WILL BE GLORY UNTOLD.\r\n WHEN THE TOWN LIKE A GREAT\r\n BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!\r\n Near, nearer that war,\r\n And that ecstasy comes,\r\n We hear the trees beating\r\n Invisible drums.\r\n The fields of the night\r\n Are starlit above,\r\n Our girls are white torches\r\n Of conquest and love.\r\n No nerve without will,\r\n And no breast without breath,\r\n We whirl with the planets\r\n That never know death!",
          " The thin moonlight with trickling ray,\r\n Thridding the boughs of silver may,\r\n Trembles in beauty, pale and cool,\r\n On folded flower, and mantled pool.\r\n All in a haze the rushes lean - \r\n And he - he sits, with chin between\r\n His two cold hands; his bare feet set\r\n Deep in the grasses, green and wet.\r\n About his head a hundred rings\r\n Of gold loop down to meet his wings,\r\n Whose feathers arched their stillness through\r\n Gleam with slow-gathering drops of dew.\r\n The mouse-bat peers; the stealthy vole\r\n Creeps from the covert of its hole;\r\n A shimmering moth its pinions furls,\r\n Grey in the moonshine of his curls;\r\n 'Neath the faint stars the night-airs stray,\r\n Scattering the fragrance of the may;\r\n And with each stirring of the bough\r\n Shadow beclouds his childlike brow.",
          " Few footsteps stray when dusk droops o'er\r\n The tailor's old stone-lintelled door:\r\n There sits he stitching half asleep,\r\n Beside his smoky tallow dip.\r\n 'Click, click,' his needle hastes, and shrill\r\n Cries back the cricket 'neath the sill.\r\n Sometimes he stays, and o'er his thread\r\n Leans sidelong his old tousled head;\r\n Or stoops to peer with half-shut eye\r\n When some strange footfall echoes by;\r\n Till clearer gleams his candle's spark\r\n Into the dusty summer dark.\r\n Then from his crosslegs he gets down,\r\n To find how dark the evening's grown;\r\n And hunched-up in his door he'll hear\r\n The cricket whistling crisp and clear;\r\n And so beneath the starry grey\r\n Will mutter half a seam away.",
          " Only until this cigarette is ended,\r\n A little moment at the end of all,\r\n While on the floor the quiet ashes fall,\r\n And in the firelight to a lance extended,\r\n Bizarrely with the jazzing music blended,\r\n The broken shadow dances on the wall,\r\n I will permit my memory to recall\r\n The vision of you, by all my dreams attended.\r\n And then adieu,--farewell!--the dream is done.\r\n Yours is a face of which I can forget\r\n The color and the features, every one,\r\n The words not ever, and the smiles not yet;\r\n But in your day this moment is the sun\r\n Upon a hill, after the sun has set.",
          " It seemed that out of the battle I escaped\r\n Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped\r\n Through granites which Titanic wars had groined.\r\n Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned,\r\n Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred.\r\n Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared\r\n With piteous recognition in fixed eyes,\r\n Lifting distressful hands as if to bless.\r\n And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall;\r\n With a thousand fears that vision's face was grained;\r\n Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground,\r\n And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan.\r\n \"Strange, friend,\" I said, \"Here is no cause to mourn.\"\r\n \"None,\" said the other, \"Save the undone years,\r\n The hopelessness.Whatever hope is yours,\r\n Was my life also; I went hunting wild\r\n After the wildest beauty in the world,\r\n Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair,\r\n But mocks the steady running of the hour,\r\n And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here.\r\n For by my glee might many men have laughed,\r\n And of my weeping something has been left,\r\n Which must die now.I mean the truth untold,\r\n The pity of war, the pity war distilled.\r\n Now men will go content with what we spoiled.\r\n Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled.\r\n They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress,\r\n None will break ranks, though nations trek from progress.\r\n Courage was mine, and I had mystery;\r\n Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery;\r\n To miss the march of this retreating world\r\n Into vain citadels that are not walled.\r\n Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels\r\n I would go up and wash them from sweet wells,\r\n Even with truths that lie too deep for taint.\r\n I would have poured my spirit without stint\r\n But not through wounds; not on the cess of war.\r\n Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were.\r\n I am the enemy you killed, my friend.\r\n I knew you in this dark; for so you frowned\r\n Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed.\r\n I parried; but my hands were loath and cold.\r\n Let us sleep now . . .\"",
          " Rose, like dim battlements, the hills and reared\r\n Steep crags into the fading primrose sky;\r\n But in the desolate valleys fell small rain,\r\n Mingled with drifting cloud. I saw one come,\r\n Like the fierce passion of that vacant place,\r\n His face turned glittering to the evening sky;\r\n His eyes, like grey despair, fixed satelessly\r\n On the still, rainy turrets of the storm;\r\n And all his armour in a haze of blue.\r\n He held no sword, bare was his hand and clenched,\r\n As if to hide the inextinguishable blood\r\n Murder had painted there. And his wild mouth\r\n Seemed spouting echoes of deluded thoughts.\r\n Around his head, like vipers all distort,\r\n His locks shook, heavy-laden, at each stride.\r\n If fire may burn invisible to the eye;\r\n O, if despair strive everlastingly;\r\n Then haunted here the creature of despair,\r\n Fanning and fanning flame to lick upon\r\n A soul still childish in a blackened hell.",
          " Romance was always young.\r\n You come today\r\n Just eight years old\r\n With marvellous dark hair.\r\n Younger than Dante found you\r\n When you turned\r\n His heart into the way\r\n That found the heavenly stair.\n\r\n Perhaps we must be strangers.\r\n I confess\r\n My soul this hour is Dante's,\r\n And your care\r\n Should be for dolls\r\n Whose painted hands caress\r\n Your marvellous dark hair.\n\r\n Romance, with moonflower face\r\n And morning eyes,\r\n And lips whose thread of scarlet prophesies\r\n The canticles of a coming king unknown,\r\n Remember, when you join him\r\n On his throne,\r\n Even me, your far off troubadour,\r\n And wear\r\n For me some trifling rose\r\n Beneath your veil,\r\n Dying a royal death,\r\n Happy and pale,\r\n Choked by the passion,\r\n The wonder and the snare,\r\n The glory and despair\r\n That still will haunt and own\r\n Your marvellous dark hair.",
          " Umbrageous cedars murmuring symphonies\r\n Stooped in late twilight o'er dark Denmark's Prince:\r\n He sat, his eyes companioned with dream - \r\n Lustrous large eyes that held the world in view\r\n As some entranc'd child's a puppet show.\r\n Darkness gave birth to the all-trembling stars,\r\n And a far roar of long-drawn cataracts,\r\n Flooding immeasurable night with sound.\r\n He sat so still, his very thoughts took wing,\r\n And, lightest Ariels, the stillness haunted\r\n With midge-like measures; but, at last, even they\r\n Sank 'neath the influences of his night.\r\n The sweet dust shed faint perfume in the gloom;\r\n Through all wild space the stars' bright arrows fell\r\n On the lone Prince - the troubled son of man - \r\n On Time's dark waters in unearthly trouble:\r\n Then, as the roar increased, and one fair tower\r\n Of cloud took sky and stars with majesty,\r\n He rose, his face a parchment of old age,\r\n Sorrow hath scribbled o'er, and o'er, and o'er.\n",

an' when I got a chance, you bet I aidged up near her.\r\nAn' Farmer Dobbs's girl was there, the one 'at Jim was sweet on,\r\nAn' Cyrus Jones an' Mandy Smith an' Faith an' Patience Deaton.\r\nThen Parson Brown an' Lawyer Jones were present--all attention,\r\nAn' piles on piles of other folks too numerous to mention.\r\nThe master rose an' briefly said: \"Good friends, dear brother Crawford,\r\nTo spur the pupils' minds along, a little prize has offered.\r\nTo him who spells the best to-night--or 't may be 'her'--no tellin'--\r\nHe offers ez a jest reward, this precious work on spellin'.\"\r\nA little blue-backed spellin'-book with fancy scarlet trimmin';\r\nWe boys devoured it with our eyes--so did the girls an' women.\r\nHe held it up where all could see, then on the table set it,\r\nAn' ev'ry speller in the house felt mortal bound to get it.\r\nAt his command we fell in line, prepared to do our dooty,\r\nOutspell the rest an' set 'em down, an' carry home the booty.\r\n'T was then the merry times began, the blunders, an' the laffin',\r\nThe nudges an' the nods an' winks an' stale good-natured chaffin'.\r\nOle Uncle Hiram Dane was there, the clostest man a-livin',\r\nWhose only bugbear seemed to be the dreadful fear o' givin'.\r\nHis beard was long, his hair uncut, his clothes all bare an' dingy;\r\nIt wasn't 'cause the man was pore, but jest so mortal stingy;\r\nAn' there he sot by Sally Riggs a-smilin' an' a-smirkin',\r\nAn' all his children lef' to home a diggin' an' a-workin'.\r\nA widower he was, an' Sal was thinkin' 'at she 'd wing him;\r\nI reckon he was wond'rin' what them rings o' hern would bring him.\r\nAn' when the spellin'-test commenced, he up an' took his station,\r\nA-spellin' with the best o' them to beat the very nation.\r\nAn' when he 'd spell some youngster down, he 'd turn to look at Sally,\r\nAn' say: \"The teachin' nowadays can't be o' no great vally.\"\r\nBut true enough the adage says, \"Pride walks in slipp'ry places,\"\r\nFur soon a thing occurred that put a smile on all our faces.\r\nThe laffter jest kep' ripplin' 'roun' an' teacher could n't quell it,\r\nFur when he give out \"charity\" ole Hiram could n't spell it.\r\nBut laffin' 's ketchin' an' it throwed some others off their bases,\r\nAn' folks 'u'd miss the very word that seemed to fit their cases.\r\nWhy, fickle little Jessie Lee come near the house upsettin'\r\nBy puttin' in a double \"kay\" to spell the word \"coquettin'.\"\r\nAn' when it come to Cyrus Jones, it tickled me all over--\r\nHim settin' up to Mandy Smith an' got sot down on \"lover.\"\r\nBut Lawyer Jones of all gone men did shorely look the gonest,\r\nWhen he found out that he 'd furgot to put the \"h\" in \"honest.\"\r\nAn' Parson Brown, whose sermons were too long fur toleration,\r\nCaused lots o' smiles by missin' when they give out \"condensation.\"\r\nSo one by one they giv' it up--the big words kep' a-landin',\r\nTill me an' Nettie Gray was left, the only ones a-standin',\r\nAn' then my inward strife began--I guess my mind was petty--\r\nI did so want that spellin'-book; but then to spell down Nettie\r\nJest sort o' went ag'in my grain--I somehow could n't do it,\r\nAn' when I git a notion fixed, I 'm great on stickin' to it.\r\nSo when they giv' the next word out--I had n't orter tell it,\r\nBut then 't was all fur Nettie's sake--I missed so's she could spell it.\r\nShe spelt the word, then looked at me so lovin'-like an' mello',\r\nI tell you 't sent a hunderd pins a shootin' through a fello'.\r\nO' course I had to stand the jokes an' chaffin' of the fello's,\r\nBut when they handed her the book I vow I was n't jealous.\r\nWe sung a hymn, an' Parson Brown dismissed us like he orter,\r\nFur, la! he 'd learned a thing er two an' made his blessin' shorter.\r\n'T was late an' cold when we got out, but Nettie liked cold weather,\r\nAn' so did I, so we agreed we 'd jest walk home together.\r\nWe both wuz silent, fur of words we nuther had a surplus,\r\n'Till she spoke out quite sudden like, \"You missed that word on purpose.\"\r\nWell, I declare it frightened me; at first I tried denyin',\r\nBut Nettie, she jest smiled an' smiled, she knowed that I was lyin'.\r\nSez she: \"That book is yourn by right;\" sez I: \"It never could be--\r\nI--I--you--ah--\" an' there I stuck, an' well she understood me.\r\nSo we agreed that later on when age had giv' us tether,\r\nWe 'd jine our lots an' settle down to own that book together.",

His brav'ry\r\nRenders him royal--a king.\r\nIf he was only a chattel,\r\nHonor the ransom may pay\r\nOf the royal, the loyal black giant\r\nWho fought for his country that day.\n\r\nNoble and bright is the story,\r\nWorthy the touch of the lyre,\r\nSculptor or poet should find it\r\nFull of the stuff to inspire.\r\nBeat it in brass and in copper,\r\nTell it in storied line,\r\nSo that the world may remember\r\nBlack Samson of Brandywine.",
          "(from Baudelaire.)\n\n\n\r\nThe night Don Juan came to pay his fees\r\nTo Charon, by the caverned water's shore,\r\nA beggar, proud-eyed as Antisthenes,\r\nStretched out his knotted fingers on the oar.\n\r\nMournful, with drooping breasts and robes unsewn\r\nThe shapes of women swayed in ebon skies,\r\nTrailing behind him with a restless moan\r\nLike cattle herded for a sacrifice.\n\r\nHere, grinning for his wage, stood Sganarelle,\r\nAnd here Don Luis pointed, bent and dim,\r\nTo show the dead who lined the holes of Hell,\r\nThis was that impious son who mocked at him.\n\r\nThe hollow-eyed, the chaste Elvira came,\r\nTrembling and veiled, to view her traitor spouse.\r\nWas it one last bright smile she thought to claim,\r\nSuch as made sweet the morning of his vows?\n\r\nA great stone man rose like a tower on board,\r\nStood at the helm and cleft the flood profound:\r\nBut the calm hero, leaning on his sword,\r\nGazed back, and would not offer one look round.",
          "A wan new garment of young green\r\nTouched, as you turned your soft brown hair\r\nAnd in me surged the strangest prayer\r\nEver in lover's heart hath been.\n\r\nThat I who saw your youth's bright page,\r\nA rainbow change from robe to robe,\r\nMight see you on this earthly globe,\r\nCrowned with the silver crown of age.\n\r\nYour dear hair powdered in strange guise,\r\nYour dear face touched with colours pale:\r\nAnd gazing through the mask and veil\r\nThe mirth of your immortal eyes.",

          "A worthy couple, man and wife,\r\nDragged on a discontented life:\r\nThe reason, I should state,\r\nThat it was destitute of joys,\r\nWas that they had a dozen boys\r\nTo feed and educate,\r\nAnd nothing such patience demands\r\nAs having twelve boys on your hands!\n\r\nFor twenty years they tried their best\r\nTo keep those urchins neatly dressed\r\nAnd teach them to be good,\r\nBut so much labor it involved\r\nThat, in the end, they both resolved\r\nTo lose them in a wood,\r\nThough nothing a parent annoys\r\nLike heartlessly losing his boys!\n\r\nSo when their sons had gone to bed,\r\nThough bitter tears the couple shed,\r\nThey laid their little plan.\r\n\"Faut b'en que 'a s'fasse. Quand m'me,\"\r\nThe woman said, \"J'en suis tout' bl'me.\"\r\n\"'a colle!\" observed the man,\r\n\"Mais 'a coute, que ces gosses fichus!\r\nB'en, quoi! Faut qu'i's soient perdus!\"\n\r\n(I've quite omitted to explain\r\nThat they were natives of Touraine;\r\nI see I must translate.)\r\n\"Of course it must be done, and still,\"\r\nThe wife remarked, \"it makes me ill.\"\r\n\"You bet!\" replied her mate:\r\n\"But we've both of us counted the cost,\r\nAnd the kids simply have to be lost!\"\n\r\nBut, while they plotted, every word\r\nThe youngest of the urchins heard,\r\nAnd winked the other eye;\r\nHis height was only two feet three.\r\n(I might remark, in passing, he\r\nWas little, but O My!)\r\nHe added: \"I'd better keep mum.\"\r\n(He was foxy, was Hop O' My Thumb!)\n\r\nThey took the boys into the wood,\r\nAnd lost them, as they said they should,\r\nAnd came in silence back.\r\nAlas for them! Hop O' My Thumb\r\nAt every step had dropped a crumb,\r\nAnd so retraced the track.\r\nWhile the parents sat mourning their fate\r\nHe led the boys in at the gate!\n\r\nHe placed his hand upon his heart,\r\nAnd said: \"You think you're awful smart,\r\nBut I have foiled you thus!\"\r\nHis parents humbly bent the knee,\r\nAnd meekly said: \"H. O. M. T.,\r\nYou're one too much for us!\"\r\nAnd both of them solemnly swore\r\n\"We won't never do so no more!\"\n\n\r\nThe Moral is: While I do not\r\nEndeavor to condone the plot,\r\nI still maintain that one\r\nShould have no chance of being foiled,\r\nAnd having one's arrangements spoiled\r\nBy one's ingenious son.\r\nIf you turn down your children, with pain,\r\nTake care they don't turn up again!",

          "I\n\r\nHeed me, feed me, I am hungry, I am red-tongued with desire;\r\nBoughs of balsam, slabs of cedar, gummy fagots of the pine,\r\nHeap them on me, let me hug them to my eager heart of fire,\r\nRoaring, soaring up to heaven as a symbol and a sign.\r\nBring me knots of sunny maple, silver birch and tamarack;\r\nLeaping, sweeping, I will lap them with my ardent wings of flame;\r\nI will kindle them to glory, I will beat the darkness back;\r\nStreaming, gleaming, I will goad them to my glory and my fame.\r\nBring me gnarly limbs of live-oak, aid me in my frenzied fight;\r\nStrips of iron-wood, scaly blue-gum, writhing redly in my hold;\r\nWith my lunge of lurid lances, with my whips that flail the night,\r\nThey will burgeon into beauty, they will foliate in gold.\r\nLet me star the dim sierras, stab with light the inland seas;\r\nRoaming wind and roaring darkness! seek no mercy at my hands;\r\nI will mock the marly heavens, lamp the purple prairies,\r\nI will flaunt my deathless banners down the far, unhouseled lands.\r\nIn the vast and vaulted pine-gloom where the pillared forests frown,\r\nBy the sullen, bestial rivers running where God only knows,\r\nOn the starlit coral beaches when the combers thunder down,\r\nIn the death-spell of the barrens, in the shudder of the snows;\r\nIn a blazing belt of triumph from the palm-leaf to the pine,\r\nAs a symbol of defiance lo! the wilderness I span;\r\nAnd my beacons burn exultant as an everlasting sign\r\nOf unending domination, of the mastery of Man;\r\nI, the Life, the fierce Uplifter, I that weaned him from the mire;\r\nI, the angel and the devil, I, the tyrant and the slave;\r\nI, the Spirit of the Struggle; I, the mighty God of Fire;\r\nI, the Maker and Destroyer; I, the Giver and the Grave.\n\n\r\nII\n\r\nGather round me, boy and grey-beard, frontiersman of every kind.\r\nFew are you, and far and lonely, yet an army forms behind:\r\nBy your camp-fires shall they know you, ashes scattered to the wind.\n\r\nPeer into my heart of solace, break your bannock at my blaze;\r\nSmoking, stretched in lazy shelter, build your castles as you gaze;\r\nOr, it may be, deep in dreaming, think of dim, unhappy days.\n\r\nLet my warmth and glow caress you, for your trails are grim and hard;\r\nLet my arms of comfort press you, hunger-hewn and battle-scarred:\r\nO my lovers! how I bless you with your lives so madly marred!\n\r\nFor you seek the silent spaces, and their secret lore you glean:\r\nFor you win the savage races, and the brutish Wild you wean;\r\nAnd I gladden desert places, where camp-fire has never been.\n\r\nFrom the Pole unto the Tropics is there trail ye have not dared?\r\nAnd because you hold death lightly, so by death shall you be spared,\r\n(As the sages of the ages in their pages have declared).\n\r\nOn the roaring Arkilinik in a leaky bark canoe;\r\nUp the cloud of Mount McKinley, where the avalanche leaps through;\r\nIn the furnace of Death Valley, when the mirage glimmers blue.\n\r\nNow a smudge of wiry willows on the weary Kuskoquim;\r\nNow a flare of gummy pine-knots where Vancouver's scaur is grim;\r\nNow a gleam of sunny ceiba, when the Cuban beaches dim.\n\r\nAlways, always God's Great Open: lo! I burn with keener light\r\nIn the corridors of silence, in the vestibules of night;\r\n'Mid the ferns and grasses gleaming, was there ever gem so bright?\n\r\nNot for weaklings, not for women, like my brother of the hearth;\r\nRing your songs of wrath around me, I was made for manful mirth,\r\nIn the lusty, gusty greatness, on the bald spots of the earth.\n\r\nMen, my masters! men, my lovers! ye have fought and ye have bled;\r\nGather round my ruddy embers, softly glowing is my bed;\r\nBy my heart of solace dreaming, rest ye and be comforted!\n\n\r\nIII\n\r\nI am dying, O my masters! by my fitful flame ye sleep;\r\nMy purple plumes of glory droop forlorn.\r\nGrey ashes choke and cloak me, and above the pines there creep\r\nThe stealthy silver moccasins of morn.\r\nThere comes a countless army, it's the Legion of the Light;\r\nIt tramps in gleaming triumph round the world;\r\nAnd before its jewelled lances all the shadows of the night\r\nBack in to abysmal darknesses are hurled.\n\r\nLeap to life again, my lovers! ye must toil and never tire;\r\nThe day of daring, doing, brightens clear,\r\nWhen the bed of spicy cedar and the jovial camp-fire\r\nMust only be a memory of cheer.\r\nThere is hope and golden promise in the vast portentous dawn;\r\nThere is glamour in the glad, effluent sky:\r\nGo and leave me; I will dream of you and love you when you're gone;\r\nI have served you, O my masters! let me die.\n\r\nA little heap of ashes, grey and sodden by the rain,\r\nWind-scattered, blurred and blotted by the snow:\r\nLet that be all to tell of me, and glorious again,\r\nYe things of greening gladness, leap and glow!\r\nA black scar in the sunshine by the palm-leaf or the pine,\r\nBlind to the night and dead to all desire;\r\nYet oh, of life and uplift what a symbol and a sign!\r\nYet oh, of power and conquest what a destiny is mine!\r\nA little heap of ashes - Yea! a miracle divine,\r\nThe foot-print of a god, all-radiant Fire.",
          "Place this bunch of mignonette\r\nIn her cold, dead hand;\r\nWhen the golden sun is set,\r\nWhere the poplars stand,\r\nBury her from sun and day,\r\nLay my little love away\r\nFrom my sight.\n\r\nShe was like a modest flower\r\nBlown in sunny June,\r\nWarm as sun at noon's high hour,\r\nChaster than the moon.\r\nAh, her day was brief and bright,\r\nEarth has lost a star of light;\r\nShe is dead.\n\r\nSoftly breathe her name to me,--\r\nAh, I loved her so.\r\nGentle let your tribute be;\r\nNone may better know\r\nHer true worth than I who weep\r\nO'er her as she lies asleep--\r\nSoft asleep.\n\r\nLay these lilies on her breast,\r\nThey are not more white\r\nThan the soul of her, at rest\r\n'Neath their petals bright.\r\nChant your aves soft and low,\r\nSolemn be your tread and slow,--\r\nShe is dead.\n\r\nLay her here beneath the grass,\r\nCool and green and sweet,\r\nWhere the gentle brook may pass\r\nCrooning at her feet.\r\nNature's bards shall come and sing,\r\nAnd the fairest flowers shall spring\r\nWhere she lies.\n\r\nSafe above the water's swirl,\r\nShe has crossed the bar;\r\nEarth has lost a precious pearl,\r\nHeaven has gained a star,\r\nThat shall ever sing and shine,\r\nTill it quells this grief of mine\r\nFor my love.",
          "The meet was at \"The Cock and Pye\r\nBy Charles and Martha Enderby,\"\r\nThe grey, three-hundred-year-old inn\r\nLong since the haunt of Benjamin\r\nThe highwayman, who rode the bay.\r\nThe tavern fronts the coaching way,\r\nThe mail changed horses there of old.\r\nIt has a strip of grassy mould\r\nIn front of it, a broad green strip.\r\nA trough, where horses' muzzles dip,\r\nStands opposite the tavern front,\r\nAnd there that morning came the hunt,\r\nTo fill that quiet width of road\r\nAs full of men as Framilode,\r\nIs full of sea when tide is in.\r\nThe stables were alive with din\r\nFrom dawn until the time of meeting.\r\nA pad-groom gave a cloth a beating,\r\nKnocking the dust out with a stake.\r\nTwo men cleaned stalls with fork and rake,\r\nAnd one went whistling to the pump,\r\nThe handle whined, ker-lump, ker-lump,\r\nI The water splashed into the pail,\r\nAnd, as he went, it left a trail,\r\nLipped over on the yard's bricked paving.\r\nTwo grooms (sent on before) were shaving\r\nThere in the yard, at glasses propped\r\nOn jutting bricks; they scraped and stropped,\r\nAnd felt their chins and leaned and peered,\r\nA woodland day was what they feared\r\n(As second horseman), shaving there.\r\nThen, in the stalls where hunters were,\r\nStraw rustled as the horses shifted,\r\nThe hayseeds ticked and haystraws drifted\r\nFrom racks as horses tugged their feed.\r\nSlow gulping sounds of steady greed\r\nCame from each stall, and sometimes stampings,\r\nWhinnies (at well-known steps) and rampings,\r\nTo see the horse in the' next stall.\r\nOutside, the spangled cock did call\r\nTo scattering grain that Martha flung.\r\nAnd many a time a mop was wrung\r\nBy Susan ere the floor was clean.\r\nThe harness-room, that busy scene,\r\nClinked and chinked from ostlers brightening\r\nRings and bits with ,dips of whitening,\r\nRubbing fox-flecks out of stirrups,\r\nDumbing buckles of their chirrups\r\nBy the touch of oily feathers.\r\nSome, with stag's bones rubbed at leathers,\r\nBrushed at saddle-flaps or hove\r\nSaddle-linings to the stove.\r\nBlue smoke from strong tobacco drifted\r\nOut of the yard, the passers snifft it,\r\nMixed with the strong ammonia flavour\r\nOf horses' stables and the savour\r\nOf saddle-paste and polish spirit\r\nWhich put the gleam on flap and tirrit.\r\nThe grooms in shirts with rolled-up sleeves,\r\nBelted by girths of coloured weaves,\r\nGroomed the clipped hunters in their stalls.\r\nOne said: \"My dad cured saddle-galls,\r\nHe called it Dr. Barton's cure-\r\nHog's lard and borax, laid on pure.\"\r\nAnd others said: \"Ge' back, my son,\"\r\n\"Stand over, girl; now, girl, ha' done.\"\r\n\"Now, boy, no snapping; gently. Crikes!\r\nHe gives a rare pinch when he likes.\"\r\n\"Drawn blood? I thought he looked a biter.\"\r\n\"I give 'em all sweet spit of nitre\r\nFor that, myself.: that sometimes cures.\"\r\n\"Now, Beauty, mind them feet of yours.\"\r\nThey groomed, and sissed with hissing notes\r\nTo keep the dust out of their throats.\n\r\nThere came again and yet again\r\nThe feed-box lid, the swish of grain,\r\nOr Joe's boots stamping in the loft,\r\nThe hay-fork's stab and then the soft\r\nHay's scratching slither down the shoot.\r\nThen with a thud some horse's foot\r\nStamped, and the gulping munch again\r\nResumed its lippings at the grain.\n\r\nThe road outside the inn was quiet\r\nSave for the poor, mad, restless pyat\r\nHopping his hanging wicker-cage.\r\nNo calmative of sleep or sage\r\nWill cure the fever to be free.\r\nHe shook the wicker ceaselessly\r\nNow up, now down, but never out,\r\nOn wind-waves, being blown about,\r\nLooking for dead things good to eat.\r\nHis cage was strewn with scattered wheat.\n\r\nAt ten o'clock, the Doctor's lad\r\nBrought up his master's hunting pad\r\nAnd put him in a stall, and leaned\r\nAgainst the stall, and sissed, and cleaned\r\nThe port and cannons of his curb.\r\nHe chewed a sprig of smelling herb.\r\nHe sometimes stopped, and spat, and chid\r\nThe silly things his master did.\n\r\nAt twenty past, old Baldock strode\r\nHis plough man's straddle down the road.\r\nAn old man with a gaunt, burnt face,\r\nHis eyes rapt back on some far place\r\nLike some starved, half-mad saint in bliss\r\nIn God's world through the rags of this.\r\nHe leaned upon a stake of ash\r\nCut from a sapling: many a gash\r\nWas in his old, full-skirted coat.\r\nThe twisted muscles in his throat\r\nMoved, as he swallowed, like taut cord.\r\nHis oaken face was seamed and gored;\r\nHe halted by the inn and stared\r\nOn that far bliss, that place prepared,\r\nBeyond his eyes, beyond his mind.\n\r\nThen Thomas Copp, of Cowfoot's Wynd,\r\nDrove up; and stopped to take a glass.\r\n\"I hope they'll gallop on my grass,\"\r\nHe said; \"my little girl does sing\r\nTo see the red coats galloping.\r\nIt's good for grass, too, to be trodden\r\nExcept they poach it, where it's sodden.\"\n\r\nThen Billy Waldrist, from the Lynn,\r\nWith Jockey Hill, from Pitts, came in\r\nAnd had a sip of gin and stout\r\nTo help the jockey's sweatings out.\r\n\"Rare day for scent,\" the jockey said.\r\nA pony like a feather bed\r\nOn four short sticks, took place aside.\r\nThe little girl who rode astride\r\nWatched everything with eyes that glowed\r\nWith glory in the horse she rode.\n\r\nAt half-past ten some lads on foot\r\nCame to be beaters to a shoot\r\nOf rabbits on the Warren Hill.\r\nRough sticks they had, and Hob and Jill,\r\nTheir ferrets, in a bag, and netting.\r\nThey talked of dinner-beer and betting,\r\nAnd jeered at those who stood around.,\r\nThey rolled their dogs upon the ground,\r\nAnd teased them: \"Rats,\" they cried, \"go fetch!\"\r\n\"Go seek, good Roxer; 'z bite, good betch.\r\nWhat dinner-beer 'll they give us, lad?\r\nSex quarts the lot last year we had.\r\nThey'd ought to give us seven this.\r\nSeek, Susan; what a betch it is.\"\n\r\nA pommle cob came trotting up,\r\nRound-bellied like a drinking-cup,\r\nBearing on back a pommle man,\r\nRound-bellied like a drinking-can,\r\nThe clergyman from Condicote.\r\nHis face was scarlet from his trot,\r\nHis white hair bobbed about his head\r\nAs halos do round clergy dead.\r\nHe asked Tom Copp, \" How long to wait?\"\r\nHis loose mouth opened like a gate,\r\nTo pass the wagons of his speech.\r\nHe had a mighty voice to preach,\r\nThough indolent in other matters.\r\nHe let his children go in tatters.\n\r\nHis daughter Madge on foot, flush-cheekt,\r\nIn broken hat and boots that leakt,\r\nWith bits of hay all over her,\r\nHer plain face grinning at the stir\r\n(A broad pale face, snub-nosed, with speckles\r\nOf sandy eyebrows sprinkt with freckles),\r\nCame after him and stood apart\r\nBeside the darling of her heart,\r\nMiss Hattie Dyce from Baydon Dean,\r\nA big young fair one, chiselled clean\r\nBrow, chin and nose, with great blue eyes\r\nAll innocence and sweet surprise,\r\nAnd golden hair piled coil on coil,\r\nToo beautiful for time to spoil.\r\nThey talked in undertones together,\r\nNot of the hunting, nor the weather.\n\r\nOld Steven from Scratch Steven Place\r\n(A white beard and a rosy face)\r\nCame next on his stringhalty grey.\r\n\"I've come to see the hounds away,\"\r\nHe said \"and ride a field or two.\r\nWe old have better things to do\r\nThan breaking all our necks for fun.\"\r\nHe shone on people like the sun,\r\nAnd on himself for shining so.\n\r\nThree men came riding in a row:\r\nJohn Pym, a bull-man, quick to strike,\r\nGross and blunt-headed like a shrike,\r\nYet sweet-voiced as a piping flute;\r\nTom See, the trainer, from the Toot,\r\nRed, with an angry, puzzled face\r\nAnd mouth twitched upward out of place,\r\nSucking cheap grapes and spitting seeds;\r\nAnd Stone, of Bartle's Cattle Feeds,\r\nA man whose bulk of flesh and bone\r\nMade people call him Twenty Stone.\r\nHe was the man who stood a pull\r\nAt Tencombe with the Jersey bull,\r\nAnd brought the bull back to his stall.\n\r\nSome children ranged the tavern-wall,\r\nSucking their thumbs and staring hard;\r\nSome grooms brought horses from the yard.\r\nJane Selbie said to Ellen Tranter,\r\n\"A lot on 'em come doggin', ant her?\"\r\n\" A lot on 'em,\" said Ellen. \"Look,\r\n\"There'm Mr. Gaunt of Water's Hook.\r\nThey say he'\" (whispered). \"Law!\" said Jane.\r\nGaunt flung his heel across the mane,\r\nAnd slithered from his horse and stamped.\r\n\"Boots tight,\" he said, \"my, feet are cramped.\"\r\nA loose-shod horse came clicking-clack;\r\nNick Wolvesey on a hired hack\r\nCame tittup, like a cup and ball.\r\nOne saw the sun, moon, stars, and all\r\nThe great green earth twixt him and saddle;\r\nThen Molly Wolvesey riding straddle,\r\nRed as a rose with eyes like sparks;\r\nTwo boys from college out for larks\r\nHunted bright Molly for a smile,\r\nBut were not worth their quarry's while.\n\r\nTwo eyeglassed gunners dressed in tweed\r\nCame with a spaniel on a lead\r\nAnd waited for a fellow-gunner.\r\nThe parson's son, the famous runner,\r\nCame dressed to follow hounds on foot.\r\nHis knees were red as yew-tree root\r\nFrom being bare, day in, day out.\r\nHe wore a blazer, and a clout\r\n(His sweater's arms) tied round his neck.\r\nHis football shorts had many a speck\r\nAnd splash of mud from many a fall\r\nGot as he picked the slippery ball\r\nHeeled out behind a breaking scrum.\r\nHe grinned at people, but was dumb,\r\nNot like these lousy foreigners.\r\nThe otter-hounds and harriers\r\nFrom Godstow to the Wye all knew him.\r\nAnd with him came the stock which grew him,\r\nThe parson and his sporting wife;\r\nShe was a stout one, full of life,\r\nWith red, quick, kindly, manly face.\r\nShe held the knave, queen, king and ace,\r\nIn every hand she played with men.\r\nShe was no sister to the hen,\r\nBut fierce and minded to be queen.\r\nShe wore a coat and skirt of green,\r\nA waistcoat cut of hunting red,\r\nHer tiepin was a fox's head.\r\nThe parson was a manly one,\r\nHis jolly eyes were bright with fun.\r\nHis jolly mouth was well inclined\r\nTo cry aloud his jolly mind\r\nTo everyone, in jolly terms.\r\nHe did not talk of churchyard worms,\r\nBut of our privilege as dust\r\nTo box a lively bout with lust\r\nEre going to heaven to rejoice.\r\nHe loved the sound of his own voice,\r\nHis talk was like a charge of horse,\r\nHis build was all compact, for force,\r\nWell-knit, well-made, well-coloured, eager.\r\nHe kept no Lent to make him meagre,\r\nHe loved his God, himself and man,\r\nHe never said, \"Life's wretched span;\r\nThis wicked world,\" in any sermon.\r\nThis body that we feed the worm on,\r\nTo him, was jovial stuff that thrilled.\r\nHe liked to see the foxes killed;\r\nBut most he felt himself in clover\r\nTo hear, \"Hen left, hare right, cock over,\"\r\nAt woodside, when the leaves are brown.\r\nSome grey cathedral in a town\r\nWhere drowsy bells toll out the time\r\nTo shaven closes sweet with lime,\r\nAnd wallflower roots rive out the mortar\r\nAll summer on the Norman dortar\r\nWas certain some day to be his;\r\nNor would a mitre go amiss\r\nTo him, because he governed well.\r\nHis voice was like the tenor bell\r\nWhen services were said and sung.\r\nAnd he had read in many a tongue,\r\nArabic, Hebrew, Spanish, Greek.\n\r\nTwo bright young women, nothing meek,\r\nRode up on bicycles and propped\r\nTheir wheels in such wise that they dropped\r\nTo bring the parson's son to aid.\r\nTheir cycling suits were tailor-made,\r\nSmart, mannish, pert, but feminine.\r\nThe colour and the zest of wine\r\nWere in their presence and their bearing;\r\nLike spring, they brought the thought of pairing.\r\nThe parson's lady thought them pert.\r\nAnd they could mock a man and flirt,\r\nDo billiard tricks with corks and pennies,\r\nSing ragtime songs and win at tennis\r\nThe silver cigarette-case prize.\r\nThey had good colour and bright eyes,\r\nBright hair, bright teeth and pretty skin,\r\nWhich many lads had longed to win\r\nOn darkened stairways after dances.\r\nTheir reading was the last romances,\r\nAnd they were dashing hockey players.\r\nMen called them \"Jill and Joan, the slayers.\"\r\nThey were as bright as fresh sweet-peas.\r\nOld Farmer Bennett followed these\r\nUpon his big-boned savage black,\r\nWhose mule-teeth yellowed to bite back\r\nWhatever came within his reach.\r\nOld Bennett sat him like a leech,\r\nThe grim old rider seemed to be\r\nAs hard about the mouth as he.\n\r\nThe beaters nudged each other's ribs.\r\nWith \"There he goes, his bloody Nibs.\r\nHe come on Joe and Anty Cop,\r\nAnd beat 'em with his hunting-crop\r\nLike tho' they'd bin a sack of beans.\r\nHis pickers were a pack of queans,\r\nAnd Joe and Anty took a couple.\r\nHe caught 'em there, and banged 'em supple.\r\nWomen and men, he didn't care\r\n(He'd kill 'em some day, if he dare),\r\nHe beat the whole four nearly dead:\r\n'I'll learn 'ee rabbit in my shed;\r\nThat's how my ricks get set afire.'\r\nThat's what he said, the bloody liar;\r\nOld oaf! I'd like to burn his ricks,\r\nTh' old swine's too free with fists and sticks.\r\nHe keeps that Mrs. Jones himselve.\"\n\r\nJust like an axehead on its helve\r\nOld Bennett sat and watched the gathering.\r\nHe'd given many a man a lathering\r\nIn field or barn, and women too.\r\nHis cold eye reached the women through\r\nWith comment, and the men with scorn.\r\nHe hated women gently born,\r\nHe hated all beyond his grasp,\r\nFor he was minded like the asp,\r\nThat strikes whatever is not dust.\n\r\nCharles Copse, of Copse Hold Manor, thrust\r\nNext into view. In face and limb\r\nThe beauty and the grace of him\r\nWere like the Golden Age returned.\r\nHis grave eyes steadily discerned\r\nThe good in men and what was wise.\r\nHe had deep blue, mild-coloured eyes\r\nAnd shocks of harvest-coloured hair\r\nStill beautiful with youth. An air\r\nOr power of kindness went about him;\r\nNo heart of youth could ever doubt him\r\nOr fail to follow where he led.\r\nHe was a genius, simply bred,\r\nAnd quite unconscious of his power.\r\nHe was the very red rose flower\r\nOf all that coloured countryside.\r\nGauchos had taught him how to ride.\r\nHe knew all arts, but practised most\r\nThe art of bettering flesh and ghost\r\nIn men and lads down in the mud.\r\nHe knew no class in flesh and blood.\r\nHe loved his kind. He spent some pith,\r\nLong since, relieving Ladysmith.\r\nMany a horse he trotted tame\r\nHeading commandos from their aim\r\nIn those old days upon the veldt.\n\r\nAn old bear in a scarlet pelt\r\nCame next, old Squire Harridew,\r\nHis eyebrows gave a man the grue,\r\nSo bushy and so fierce they were;\r\nHe had a bitter tongue to swear.\r\nA fierce, hot, hard, old, stupid squire,\r\nWith all his liver made of fire,\r\nSmall brain, great courage, mulish will.\r\nThe hearts in all his house stood still\r\nWhen someone crossed the Squire's path.\r\nFor he was terrible in wrath,\r\nAnd smashed whatever came to hand.\r\nTwo things he failed to understand,\r\nThe foreigner and what was new.\r\nHis daughters, Carrie, Jane and Lou,\r\nRode with him, Carrie at his side.\r\nHis son, the ne'er-do-well, had died\r\nIn Arizona long before.\r\nThe Squire set the greatest store\r\nBy Carrie, youngest of the three,\r\nAnd lovely to the blood was she;\r\nBlonde, with a face of blush and cream,\r\nAnd eyes deep violet in their gleam,\r\nBright blue when quiet in repose.\r\nShe was a very golden rose.\r\nAnd many a man when sunset came\r\nWould see the manor windows flame,\r\nAnd think, \"My beauty's home is there.\"\r\nQueen Helen had less golden hair,\r\nQueen Cleopatra paler lips,\r\nQueen Blanche's eyes were in eclipse\r\nBy golden Carrie's glancing by.\r\nShe had a wit for mockery\r\nAnd sang mild, pretty, senseless songs\r\nOf sunsets, Heav'n and lovers' wrongs,\r\nSweet to the Squire when he had dined.\r\nA rosebud need not have a mind.\r\nA lily is not sweet from learning.\n\r\nJane looked like a dark-lantern, burning,\r\nOutwardly dark, unkempt, uncouth,\r\nBut minded like the living truth,\r\nA friend that nothing shook nor wearied.\r\nShe was not \"Darling Jane'd\" nor \" Dearie'd.\"\r\nShe was all prickles to the touch,\r\nSo sharp that many feared to clutch,\r\nSo keen that many thought her bitter,\r\nShe let the little sparrows twitter.\r\nShe had a hard, ungracious way.\r\nHer storm of hair was iron-grey,\r\nAnd she was passionate in her heart\r\nFor women's souls that burn apart,\r\nJust as her mother's had, with Squire.\r\nShe gave the sense of smouldering fire.\r\nShe was not happy being a maid,\r\nAt home, with Squire, but she stayed,\r\nEnduring life, however bleak,\r\nTo guard her sisters, who were weak,\r\nAnd force a life for them from Squire.\r\nAnd she had roused and stood his fire\r\nA hundred times, and earned his hate,\r\nTo win those two a better state.\r\nLong years before the Canon's son\r\nHad cared for her, but he had gone\r\nTo Klondyke, to the mines, for gold;\r\nTo find, in some strange way untold,\r\nA foreign grave that no men knew.\n\r\nNo depth, nor beauty, was in Lou,\r\nBut charm and fun, for she was merry,\r\nRound, sweet and little, like a cherry,\r\nWith laughter like a robin's singing;\r\nShe was not kitten-like and clinging,\r\nBut pert and arch and fond of flirting,\r\nIn mocking ways that were not hurting,\r\nAnd merry ways that women pardoned.\r\nNot being married yet she gardened.\r\nShe loved sweet music; she would sing\r\nSongs made before the German King\r\nMade England German in her mind.\r\nShe sang \"My lady is unkind,\"\r\n\"The Hunt is up,\" and those, sweet things\r\nWhich Thomas Campion set to strings,\r\n\"Thrice toss,\" and \" What,\" and \"Where are now?\"\n\r\nThe next to come was Major Howe\r\nDriv'n in a dog-cart by a groom.\r\nThe testy major was in fume\r\nTo find no hunter standing waiting;\r\nThe groom who drove him caught a rating,\r\nThe groom who had the horse in stable\r\nWas damned in half the tongues of Babel,\r\nThe Major being hot and heady\r\nWhen horse or dinner was not ready.\r\nHe was a lean, tough, liverish fellow,\r\nWith pale blue eyes (the whites pale yellow),\r\nMoustache clipped toothbrush-wise, and jaws\r\nShaved bluish like old partridge claws.\r\nWhen he had stripped his coat he made\r\nA speckless presence for parade,\r\nNew pink, white cords, and glossy tops,\r\nNew gloves, the newest thing in crops,\r\nWorn with an air that well expressed\r\nHis sense that no one else was dressed.\n\r\nQuick trotting after Major Howe\r\nCame Doctor Frome of Quickemshow,\r\nA smiling silent man whose brain\r\nKnew all of every secret pain\r\nIn every man and woman there.\r\nTheir inmost lives were all laid bare\r\nTo him, because he touched their lives\r\nWhen strong emotions sharp as knives\r\nBrought out what sort of soul each was.\r\nAs secret as the graveyard grass\r\nHe was, as he had need to be.\r\nAt some time he had had to see\r\nEach person there, sans clothes, sans mask,\r\nSans lying even, when to ask\r\nProbed a tamed spirit into truth.\n\r\nRichard, his son, a jolly youth,\r\nRode with him, fresh from Thomas's,\r\nAs merry as a yearling is\r\nIn May-time in a clover patch.\r\nHe was a gallant chick to hatch;\r\nBig, brown and smiling, blithe and kind,\r\nWith all his father's love of mind\r\nAnd greater force to give it act.\r\nTo see him when the scrum was packt,\r\nHeave, playing forward, was a sight.\r\nHis tackling was the crowd's delight\r\nIn many a danger close to goal.\r\nThe pride in the three-quarter's soul\r\nDropped, like a wet rag, when he collared.\r\nHe was as steady as a bollard,\r\nAnd gallant as a skysail yard,\r\nHe rode a chestnut mare which sparred.\r\nIn good St. Thomas' Hospital\r\nHe was the crown imperial\r\nOf all the scholars of his year.\n\r\nThe Harold lads, from Tencombe Weir,\r\nCame all on foot in corduroys,\r\nPoor widowed Mrs. Harold's boys,\r\nDick, Hal and Charles, whose father died.\r\n(Will Masemore shot him in the side\r\nBy accident at Masemore Farm.\r\nA hazel knocked Will Masemore's arm\r\nIn getting through a hedge; his gun\r\nWas not half-cocked, so it was done,\r\nAnd those three boys left fatherless.)\r\nTheir gaitered legs were in a mess\r\nWith good red mud from twenty ditches,\r\nHal's face was plastered like his ,breeches,\r\nDick chewed a twig of juniper.\r\nThey kept at distance from the stir;\r\nTheir loss had made them lads apart.\n\r\nNext came the Colways' pony-cart\r\nFrom Coln St. Evelyn's with the party.\r\nHugh Colway, jovial, bold and hearty,\r\nAnd Polly Colway's brother, John\r\n(Their horses had been both sent on,\r\nAnd Polly Colway drove them there).\r\nPoor pretty Polly Colway's hair!\r\nThe grey mare killed her at the brook\r\nDown seven springs mead at Water Hook\r\nJust one month later, poor sweet woman.\r\nHer brother was a rat-faced Roman,\r\nLean, puckered, tight-skinned from the sea,\r\nCommander in the Canace,\r\nAble to drive a horse, or ship,\r\nOr crew of men without a whip\r\nBy will, as long as they could go.\r\nHis face would wrinkle, row on row,\r\nFrom mouth to hair-roots when he laught.\r\nHe looked ahead as though his craft\r\nWere with him still, in dangerous channels.\r\nHe and Hugh Colway tossed their flannels\r\nInto the pony-cart and mounted.\r\nSix foiled attempts the watchers counted,\r\nThe horses being bickering things\r\nThat so much scarlet made like kings,\r\nSuch sidling and such pawing and shifting.\n\r\nWhen Hugh was up his mare went drifting\r\nSidelong and feeling with her heels\r\nFor horses' legs and poshay wheels,\r\nWhile lather creamed her neat clipt skin.\r\nHugh guessed her foibles with a grin.\r\nHe was a rich town-merchant's son,\r\nA wise and kind man, fond of fun,\r\nWho loved to have a troop of friends\r\nAt CoIn St. Eves for all week-ends,\r\nAnd troops of children in for tea.\r\nHe gloried in a Christmas-Tree,\r\nAnd Polly was his heart's best treasure,\r\nAnd Polly was a golden pleasure,\r\nTo everyone, to see or hear.\n\r\nPoor Polly's dying struck him queer,\r\nHe was a darkened man thereafter,\r\nCowed, silent, he would wince at laughter\r\nAnd be so gentle it was strange\r\nEven to see. Life loves to change.\n\r\nNow Coln St. Evelyn's hearths are cold,\r\nThe shutters up, the hunters sold,\r\nAnd green mould damps the locked front door.\r\nBut this was still a month before,\r\nAnd Polly, golden in the chaise,\r\nStill smiled, and there were golden days,\r\nStill thirty days, for those dear lovers.\n\r\nThe Riddens came, from Ocle Covers,\r\nBill Ridden riding Stormalong\r\n(By Tempest out of Love-me-Long),\r\nA proper handful of a horse\r\nThat nothing but the Aintree course\r\nCould bring to terms, save Bill perhaps.\r\nAll sport, from bloody war to scraps,\r\nCame well to Bill, that big-mouthed smiler.\r\nThey nicknamed him \"the mug-beguiler,\"\r\nFor Billy lived too much with horses,\r\nIn copers' yards and sharpers' courses,\r\nTo lack the sharper-coper streak.\r\nHe did not turn the other cheek\r\nWhen struck (as English Christians do);\r\nHe boxed like a Whitechapel Jew,\r\nAnd many a time his knuckles bled\r\nAgainst a racecourse-gipsy's head.\r\nFor \"hit him first and argue later\"\r\nWas truth at Billy's Alma Mater,\r\nNot love, not any bosh of love.\r\nHis hand was like a chamois glove,\r\nAnd riding was his chief delight.\r\nHe bred the chaser Chinese-White\r\nFrom Lilybud by Mandarin.\r\nAnd when his mouth tucked corners in,\r\nAnd scent was high and hounds were going,\r\nHe went across a field like snowing\r\nAnd tackled anything that came.\n\r\nHis wife, Sal Ridden, was the same,\r\nA loud, bold, blonde, abundant mare\r\nWith white horse-teeth and stooks of hair\r\n(Like polished brass) and such a manner\r\nIt flaunted from her like a banner.\r\nHer father was Torn See the trainer.\r\nShe rode a lovely earth-disdainer\r\nWhich she and Billy wished to sell.\n\r\nBehind them rode her daughter Belle,\r\nA strange, shy, lovely girl, whose face\r\nWas sweet with thought and proud with race,\r\nAnd bright with joy at riding there.\r\nShe was as good as blowing air,\r\nBut shy and difficult to know.\r\nThe kittens in the barley-mow,\r\nThe setter's toothless puppies sprawling,\r\nThe blackbird in the apple calling,\r\nAll knew her spirit more than we.\r\nSo delicate these maidens be\r\nIn loving lovely helpless things.\r\nThe Manor set, from Tencombe Rings,\r\nCame with two friends, a set of six.\r\nEd Manor with his cockerel chicks,\r\nNob, Cob and Bunny, as they called them\r\n(God help the school or rule which galled them;\r\nThey carried head), and friends from town.\r\nEd Manor trained on Tencombe Down,\r\nHe once had been a famous bat;\r\nHe had that stroke, \"the Manor-pat,\"\r\nWhich snicked the ball for three, past cover.\r\nHe once scored twenty in an over.\r\nBut now he cricketed no more.\r\nHe purpled in the face and swore\r\nAt all three sons, and trained, and told\r\nLong tales of cricketing of old,\r\nWhen he alone had saved his side.\r\nDrink made it doubtful if he lied.\r\nDrink purpled him, he could not face\r\nThe fences now, nor go the pace,\r\nHe brought his friends to meet; no more.\n\r\nHis big son Nob, at whom he swore,\r\nSwore back at him, for Nob was surly,\r\nTall, shifty, sullen-smiling, burly,\r\nQuite fearless, built with such a jaw\r\nThat no man's rule could be his law\r\nNor any woman's son his master.\r\nBoxing he relished. He could plaster\r\nAll those who boxed out Tencombe way.\r\nA front tooth had been knocked away\r\nTwo days before, which put his mouth\r\nA little to the east of south,\r\nAnd put a venom in his laughter.\n\r\nCob was a lighter lad, but dafter,\r\nJust past eighteen, while Nob was twenty.\r\nNob had no nerves but Cob had plenty,\r\nSo Cobby went where Nobby led.\r\nHe had no brains inside his head,\r\nWas fearless, just like Nob, but put\r\nSome clog of folly round his foot,\r\nWhere Nob put will of force or fraud.\r\nHe spat aside and muttered Gawd\r\nWhen vext; he took to whisky kindly\r\nAnd loved and followed Nobby blindly,\r\nAnd rode as in the saddle born.\n\r\nBun looked upon the two with scorn.\r\nHe was the youngest, and was wise.\r\nHe too was fair, with sullen eyes,\r\nHe too (a year before) had had\r\nA zest for going to the bad,\r\nWith Cob and Nob. He knew the joys\r\nOf drinking with the stable-boys,\r\nOr smoking while he filled his skin\r\nWith pints of Guinness dashed with gin\r\nAnd Cobby yelled a bawdy ditty,\r\nOr cutting Nobby for the kitty,\r\nAnd damning people's eyes and guts,\r\nOr drawing evening-church for sluts;\r\nHe knew them all and now was quit.\n\r\nSweet Polly Colway managed it\r\nAnd Bunny changed. He dropped his drink\r\n(The pleasant pit's seductive brink),\r\nHe started working in the stable,\r\nAnd well, for he was shrewd and able.\r\nHe left the doubtful female friends\r\nPicked up at Evening-Service ends,\r\nHe gave up cards and swore no more.\r\nNob called him \"The Reforming Whore,\"\r\n\"The Soul's A wakening,\" or \"The Text,\"\r\nNob being always coarse when vext.\n\r\nEd Manor's friends were Hawke and Sladd,\r\nOld college friends, the last he had,\r\nRare horsemen, but their nerves were shaken\r\nBy all the whisky they had taken.\r\nHawke's hand was trembling on his rein.\r\nHis eyes were dead-blue like a vein,\r\nHis peaked, sad face was touched with breeding,\r\nHis querulous mind was quaint from reading,\r\nHis piping voice still quirked with fun.\r\nMany a mad thing he had done,\r\nRiding to hounds and going to races.\r\nA glimmer of the gambler's graces,\r\nWit, courage, devil, touched his talk.\n\r\nSladd's big fat face was white as chalk,\r\nHis mind went wandering, swift yet solemn,\r\nTwixt winning-post and betting-column,\r\nThe weights and forms and likely colts.\r\nHe said, \"This road is full of jolts.\r\nI shall be seasick riding here.\r\nOh, damn last night with that liqueur!\"\r\nLen Stokes rode up on Peterkin;\r\nHe owned the downs by Baydon Whin,\r\nAnd grazed some thousand sheep; the boy\r\nGrinned round at men with jolly joy\r\nAt being alive and being there.\r\nHis big round face and mop of hair\r\nShone, his great teeth shone in his grin.'\r\nThe clean blood in his clear tanned skin\r\nRan merry, and his great voice mocked\r\nHis young friends present till they rocked.\n\r\nSteer Harpit came from Rowell Hill,\r\nA small, frail man, all heart and will,\r\nA sailor, as his voice betrayed.\r\nHe let his whip-thong droop and played\r\nAt snicking off the grass-blades with it.\r\nJohn Hankerton, from Compton Lythitt,\r\nWas there with Pity Hankerton,\r\nAnd Mike, their good-for-little son,\r\nBack, smiling, from his seventh job.\r\nJoan Urch was there upon her cob,\r\nTom Sparsholt on his lanky grey,\r\nJohn Restrop from Hope Goneaway,\r\nAnd Vaughan, the big black handsome devil,\r\nLoose-lipped with song and wine and revel,\r\nAll rosy from his morning tub.\n\r\nThe Godsdown tigress with her cub\r\n(Lady and Tommy Crow marsh) came.\r\nThe great eyes smouldered in the dame,\r\nWit glittered, too, which few men saw.\r\nThere was more beauty there than claw.\r\nTommy in bearing, horse and dress,\r\nWas black, fastidious handsomeness,\r\nChoice to his trimmed soul's finger-tips,\r\nHeredia's sonnets on his lips.\r\nA line undrawn, a plate not bitten,\r\nA stone uncut, a phrase unwritten\r\nThat would be perfect, made his mind.\r\nA choice pull from a rare print, signed,\r\nWas Tommy. He collected plate\r\n(Old Sheffield), and he owned each state\r\nOf all the Meryon Paris etchings.\r\nColonel Sir Button Budd of Fletchings\r\nWas there; Long Robert Thrupp was there\r\n(Three yards of him men said there were),\r\nLong as the King of Prussia's fancy.\r\nHe rode the long-legged Necromancy,\r\nA useless racehorse that could canter.\r\nGeorge Childrey with his jolly banter\r\nWas there, Nick Childrey, too, come down\r\nThe night before from London town\r\nTo hunt and have his lungs blown.clean.\r\nThe Ilsley set from Tuttocks Green\r\nWas there (old Henry Ilsley drove).\r\nCarlotta Ilsley brought her love,\r\nA flop-jowled broker from the city.\r\nMen pitied her, for she was pretty.\r\n*\r\nSome grooms and second horsemen mustered.\r\nA lot of men on foot were clustered\r\nRound the inn-door all busy drinking,\r\nOne heard the kissing glasses clinking\r\nIn passage as the tray was brought.\r\nTwo terriers (which they had there) fought\r\nThere on the green, a loud, wild whirl.\r\nBell stopped them like a gallant girl.\r\nThe hens behind the tavern clucked.\r\nThen on a horse which bit and bucked\r\n(The half-broke four-year-old Marauder)\r\nCame Minton-Price of th' Afghan border,\r\nLean, puckered, yellowed, knotted, scarred,\r\nTough as a hide-rope twisted hard,\r\nTense tiger-sinew knit to bone.\r\nStrange-wayed from having lived alone\r\nWith Kafir, Afghan and Beloosh,\r\nIn stations frozen in the Koosh\r\nWhere nothing but the bullet sings.\r\nHis mind had conquered many things\r\nPainting, mechanics, physics, law.\r\nWhite-hot, hand-beaten things to draw\r\nSelf-hammered from his own soul's stithy.\r\nHis speech was blacksmith-sparked and pithy.\r\nDanger had been his brother bred;\r\nThe stones had often been his bed\r\nIn bickers with the border-thieves.\n\r\nA chestnut mare with swerves and heaves\r\nCame plunging, scattering all the crowd,\r\nShe tossed her head and laughed aloud\r\nAnd bickered sideways past the meet.\r\nFrom pricking ears to mincing feet\r\nShe was all tense with blood and quiver,\r\nYou saw her clipt hide twitch and shiver\r\nOver her netted cords of veins.\r\nShe carried Cothill, of the Sleins,\r\nA tall, black, bright-eyed, handsome lad.\r\nGreat power and great grace he had.\r\nMen hoped the greatest things of him.\r\nHis grace made people think him slim,\r\nBut he was muscled like a horse,\r\nA sculptor would have wrought his torse\r\nIn bronze or marble for Apollo.\r\nHe loved to hurry like a swallow\r\nFor miles on miles of short-grassed sweet,\r\nBlue, hare-belled downs where dewy feet\r\nOf pure winds hurry ceaselessly,\r\nHe loved the downland like a sea.\r\nThe downland where the kestrels hover\r\nThe downland had him for a lover.\n\r\nAnd every other thing he loved\r\nIn which a clean free spirit moved.\n\r\nSo beautiful he was, so bright,\r\nHe looked to men like young delight\r\nGone courting April maidenhood,\r\nThat has the primrose in her blood,\r\nHe on his mincing lady mare.\n\r\nOck Gurney and old Pete were there\r\nRiding their bonny cobs and swearing;\r\nOck's wife had giv'n them both a fairing,\r\nA horse-rosette, red, white and blue.\r\nTheir cheeks were brown as any brew,\r\nAnd every comer to the meet\r\nSaid, \"Hello, Ock,\" or \" Morning, Pete,\r\nBe you a-going to a wedding?

His speech was plain.\r\nMaroon's head, reaching to the rein,\r\nHad half his thought before he spoke.\r\nHis \" Gone away! \"when foxes broke\r\nWas like a bell. His chief delight\r\nWas hunting fox from noon to night.\r\nHis pleasure lay in hounds and horses;\r\nHe loved the Seven Springs water-courses,\r\nThose flashing brooks (in good sound grass,\r\nWhere scent would hang like breath on glass).\r\nHe loved the English countryside:\r\nThe wine-leaved bramble in the ride,\r\nThe lichen on the apple-trees,\r\nThe poultry ranging on the lees,\r\nThe farms, the moist earth-smelling cover,\r\nHis wife's green grave at Mitcheldover,\r\nWhere snowdrops pushed at the first thaw.\r\nUnder his hide his heart was raw\r\nWith joy and pity of these things.\n\r\nThe second whip was Kitty Myngs,\r\nStill but a lad but keen and quick\r\n(Son of old Myngs, who farmed the Wick),\r\nA horse-mouthed lad who knew his work.\r\nHe rode the big black horse, the Turk,\r\nAnd longed to be a huntsman bold.\r\nHe had the horse-look, sharp and old,\r\nWith much good-nature in his face.\r\nHis passion was to go the pace,\r\nHis blood was crying for a taming.\r\nHe was the Devil's chick for gaming,\r\nHe was a rare good lad to box.\r\nHe sometimes had a main of cocks\r\nDown at the Flags. His job with hounds\r\nAt present kept his blood in bounds\r\nFrom rioting and running hare.\r\nTom Dansey made him have a care.\r\nHe worshipped Dansey heart and soul.\r\nTo be a huntsman was his goal;\r\nTo be with hounds, to charge full tilt\r\nBlackthorns that made the gentry wilt\r\nWas his ambition and his hope.\r\nHe was a hot colt needing rope,\r\nHe was too quick to speak his passion\r\nTo suit his present huntsman's fashion.\n\r\nThe huntsman, Robin Dawe, looked round,\r\nHe sometimes called a favourite hound\r\nGently, to see the creature turn,\r\nLook happy up and wag his stern.\r\nHe smiled and nodded and saluted\r\nTo those who hailed him, as it suited,\r\nAnd patted Pip's, his hunter's neck.\r\nHis new pink was without a speck.\r\nHe was a red-faced smiling fellow,\r\nHis voice clear tenor, full and mellow,\r\nHis eyes, all fire, were black and small.\r\nHe had been smashed in many a fall.\r\nHis eyebrow had a white curved mark\r\nLeft by the bright shoe of The Lark\r\nDown in a ditch by Seven Springs.\r\nHis coat had all been trod to strings,\r\nHis ribs laid bare and shoulder broken,\r\nBeing jumped on down at Water's Oaken\r\nThe time his horse came down and rolled.\r\nHis face was of the country mould\r\nSuch as the mason sometimes cutted\r\nOn English moulding-ends which jutted\r\nOut of the church walls, centuries since.\r\nAnd as you never know the quince,\r\nHow good he is, until you try,\r\nSo, in Dawe's face, what met the eye\r\nWas only part; what lay behind\r\nWas English character and mind,\r\nGreat kindness, delicate sweet feeling\r\n(Most shy, most clever in concealing\r\nIts depth) for beauty of all sorts,\r\nGreat manliness and love of sports,\r\nA grave, wise thoughtfulness and truth,\r\nA merry fun outlasting youth,\r\nA courage terrible to see,\r\nAnd mercy for his enemy.\r\nHe had a clean-shaved face, but kept\r\nA hedge of whisker neatly clipt,\r\nA narrow strip or picture-frame\r\n(Old Dawe, the woodman, did the same),\r\nUnder his chin from ear to ear.\n\r\nBut now the resting hounds gave cheer,\r\nJoyful and Arrogant and Catch-him\r\nSmelt the glad news and ran to snatch him;\r\nThe Master's dogcart turned the bend.\r\nDamsel and Skylark knew their friend,\r\nA thrill ran through the pack like fire\r\nAnd little whimpers ran in quire.\r\nThe horses cocked and pawed and whickered,\r\nYoung Cothill 's chaser kicked and bickered\r\nAnd stood on end and struck out sparks,\r\nJoyful and Catch-him sang like larks.\r\nThere was the Master in the trap,\r\nClutching old Roman in his lap,\r\nOld Roman, crazy for his brothers,\r\nAnd putting frenzy in the others,\r\nTo set them at the dogcart wheels,\r\nWith thrusting heads and little squeals.\n\r\nThe Master put old Roman by,\r\nAnd eyed the thrusters heedfully.\r\nHe called a few pet hounds and fed\r\nThree special friends with scraps of bread,\r\nThen peeled his wraps, climbed down and strode\r\nThrough all those clamourers in the road,\r\nSaluted friends, looked round the crowd,\r\nSaw Harridew's three girls and bowed,\r\nThen took White Rabbit from the groom.\n\r\nHe was Sir Peter Bynd, of Coombe;\r\nPast sixty now, though hearty still,\r\nA living picture of good-will,\r\nAn old, grave soldier, sweet and kind,\r\nA courtier with a knightly mind,\r\nWho felt whatever thing he thought.\r\nHis face was scarred, for he had fought\r\nFive wars for us. Within his face\r\nCourage and power had their place,\r\nRough energy, decision, force.\r\nHe smiled about him from his horse.\r\nHe had a welcome and salute\r\nFor all, on horse or wheel or foot,\r\nWhatever kind of life each followed.\r\nHis tanned, drawn cheeks looked old and hollowed,\r\nBut still his bright blue eyes were young,\r\nAnd when the pack crashed into tongue,\r\nAnd stanch White Rabbit shook like fire,\r\nHe sent him at it like a flier,\r\nAnd lived with hounds while horses could\n\r\nThey'm lying in the Ghost Heath Wood,\r\nSir Peter,\" said an earth-stopper,\r\n(Old Baldy Hill), \"you'll find 'em there.\r\n'Z I come'd across I smell 'em plain.\r\nThere's one up back, down Tuttock's drain,\r\nBut, Lord, it's just a bog, the Tuttocks,\r\nHounds would be swallered to the buttocks.\r\nHeath Wood, Sir Peter's best to draw.\"\n\r\nSir Peter gave two minutes' law\r\nFor Kingston Challow and his daughter;\r\nHe said, \"They're late. We'll start the slaughter.\r\nGhost Heath, then, Dansey. We'll be going.\"\n\r\nNow, at his word, the tide was flowing.\r\nOff went Maroon, off went the hounds,\r\nDown road, then off, to Chols Elm Grounds,\r\nAcross soft turf with dead leaves cleaving\r\nAnd hillocks that the mole was heaving,\r\nMild going to those trotting feet.\r\nAfter the scarlet coats the meet\r\nCame clopping up the grass in spate;\r\nThey poached the trickle at the gate,\r\nTheir horses' feet sucked at the mud,\r\nExcitement in the horses' blood.\r\nCocked forward every ear and eye,\r\nThey quivered as the hounds went by,\r\nThey trembled when they first trod grass,\r\nThey would not let another pass,\r\nThey scattered wide up Chols Elm Hill.\r\nThe wind was westerly but still,\r\nThe sky a high fair-weather cloud,\r\nLike meadows ridge-and-furrow ploughed,\r\nJust glinting sun but scarcely moving.\r\nBlackbirds and thrushes thought of loving,\r\nCatkins were out; the day seemed tense\r\nIt was so still. At every fence\r\nCow-parsley pushed its thin green fern.\r\nWhite-violet leaves showed at the burn.\n\r\nYoung Cothill let his chaser go\r\nRound Chols Elm Field a turn or so\r\nTo soothe his edge. The riders went\r\nChatting and laughing and content\r\nIn groups of two or three together;\r\nThe hounds, a flock of shaking feather,\r\nBobbed on ahead, past Chols Elm Cop,\r\nThe horses' shoes went clip-a-clop,\r\nAlong the stony cart-track there,\r\nThe little spinney was all bare,\r\nBut in the earth-moist winter day\r\nThe scarlet coats twixt tree and spray,\r\nThe glistening horses pressing on,\r\nThe brown-faced lads, Bill, Dick and John,\r\nAnd all the hurry to arrive,\r\nWere beautiful like spring alive.\n\r\nThe hounds melted away with Master,\r\nThe tanned lads ran, the field rode faster,\r\nThe chatter joggled in the throats\r\nOf riders bumping by like boats,\r\n\"We really ought to hunt a bye day.\"\r\n\"Fine day for scent,\" \"A fly or die day.\"\r\n\"They chopped a bagman in the check,\r\nHe had a collar round his neck.\"\r\n\"Old Ridden's girl's a pretty flapper.\"\r\n\"That Vaughan's a cad, the whippersnapper.\"\r\n\"I tell' ee, lads, I seed' em plain\r\nDown in the Rough at Shifford's Main,\r\nOld Squire stamping like a Duke,\r\nSo red with blood I thought he'd puke\r\nIn appleplexie, as they do.\r\nMiss Jane stood just as white as dew\r\nAnd heard him out in just white heat,\r\nAnd then she trimmed him down a treat.\r\nAbout Miss Lou it was, or Carrie\r\n(She'd be a pretty peach to marry).\"\n\r\n\"Her'll draw up-wind, so us'll go\r\nDown by the furze, we'll see 'em so.\"\n\r\n\"Look, there they go, lad!\"\r\nThere they went,\r\nAcross the brook and up the bent,\r\nPast Primrose Wood, past Brady Ride,\r\nAlong Ghost Heath to cover side.\r\nThe bobbing scarlet, trotting pack,\r\nTurf scatters tossed behind each back,\r\nSome horses blowing with a whinny,\r\nA jam of horses in the spinney,\r\nClose to the ride-gate; leather straining,\r\nSaddles all creaking, men complaining,\r\nChaffing each other as they past,\r\nOn Ghost Heath turf they trotted fast.\n\r\nNow as they neared the Ghost Heath Wood\r\nSome riders grumbled, \"What's the good?\r\nIt's shot all day and poached all night.\r\nWe shall draw blank and lose the light,\r\nAnd lose the scent and lose the day.\r\nWhy can't he draw Hope Goneaway,\r\nOr Tuttocks Wood, instead of this?\r\nThere's no fox here, there never is.\"\n\r\nBut as he trotted up to cover\r\nRobin was watching to discover\r\nWhat chance there was, and many a token\r\nTold him that though no hound had spoken,\r\nMost of them stirred to something there.\r\nThe old hounds' muzzles searched the air,\r\nThin ghosts of scents were in their teeth\r\nFrom foxes which had crossed the Heath\r\nNot very many hours before.\r\n\"We'll find,\" he said, \"I'll bet, a score.\"\n\r\nAlong Ghost Heath they trotted well,\r\nThe hoof-cuts made the bruised earth smell,\r\nThe shaken brambles scattered drops,\r\nStray pheasants kukkered out of copse,\r\nCracking the twigs down with their knockings\r\nAnd planing out of sight with cockings;\r\nA scut or two lopped white to bramble.\n\r\nAnd now they gathered to the gamble\r\nAt Ghost Heath Wood on Ghost Heath Down.\r\nThe hounds went crackling through the brown\r\nDry stalks of bracken killed by frost.\r\nThe wood stood silent in its host\r\nOf halted trees all winter bare.\r\nThe boughs, like veins that suck the air,\r\nStretched tense, the last leaf scarcely stirred,\r\nThere came no song from any bird;\r\nThe darkness of the wood stood still\r\nWaiting for fate on Ghost Heath Hill.\n\r\nThe whips crept to the sides to view,\r\nThe Master gave the nod, and \"Leu,\r\nLeu in. Ed-hoick, ed-hoick. Leu in !\r\nWent Robin, cracking through the whin\r\nAnd through the hedge-gap into cover.\r\nThe binders crashed as hounds went over,\r\nAnd cock-cock-cock the pheasants rose.\r\nThen up went stern and down went nose,\r\nAnd Robin's cheerful tenor cried,\r\nThrough hazel-scrub and stub and ride:\r\n\"Oh, wind him! beauties, push him out,\r\nYooi, on to him, Yahout, Yahout,\r\nOh, push him out, Yooi, wind him, wind him!'\r\nThe beauties burst the scrub to find him;\r\nThey nosed the warren's clipped green lawn,\r\nThe bramble and the broom were drawn,\r\nThe covert's northern end was blank.\r\nThey turned to draw along the bank\r\nThrough thicker cover than the Rough,\r\nThrough three-and-four-year understuff\r\nWhere Robin's forearm screened his eyes;\r\n\"Yooi, find him, beauties,\" came his cries.\r\n\"Hark, hark to Daffodil,\" the laughter\r\nFall'n from his horn, brought whimpers after,\r\nFor ends of scents were everywhere.\r\nHe said, \"This Hope's a likely lair,\r\nAnd there's his billets, grey and furred.\r\nAnd George, he's moving, there's a bird.\"\r\n*\r\nA blue uneasy jay was chacking\r\n(A swearing screech, like tearing sacking)\r\nFrom tree to tree, as in pursuit,\r\nHe said, \"That's it. There's fox afoot.\r\nAnd there, they're feathering, there she speaks.\r\nGood Daffodil, good Tarrybreeks,\r\nHark there to Daffodil, hark, hark!\"\r\nThe mild horn's note, the soft-flaked spark\r\nOf music fell on that rank scent.\r\nFrom heart to wild heart magic went.\r\nThe whimpering quivered, quavered, rose.\r\n\"Daffodil has it. There she goes.\r\nOh, hark to her!\" With wild high crying\r\nFrom frantic hearts the hounds went flying\r\nTo Daffodil, for that rank taint.\r\nA waft of it came warm but faint\r\nIn Robin's mouth, and faded so.\r\n\"First find a fox, then let him go,\"\r\nCried Robin Dawe. \"For any sake\r\nRing, Charley, till you're fit to break.\"\r\nHe cheered his beauties like a lover,\r\nAnd charged beside them into cover.",

          "A fisher was casting his flies in a brook,\r\nAccording to laws of such sciences,\r\nWith a patented reel and a patented hook\r\nAnd a number of other appliances;\r\nAnd the thirty-fifth cast, which he vowed was the last\r\n(It was figured as close as a decimal),\r\nBrought suddenly out of the water a trout\r\nOf measurements infinitesimal.\n\r\nThis fish had a way that would win him a place\r\nIn the best and most polished society,\r\nAnd he looked at the fisherman full in the face\r\nWith a visible air of anxiety:\r\nHe murmered \"Alas!\" from his place in the grass,\r\nAnd then, when he'd twisted and wriggled, he\r\nRemarked in a pet that his heart was upset\r\nAnd digestion all higgledy-piggledy.\n\r\n\"I request,\" he observed, \"to be instantly flung\r\nOnce again in the pool I've been living in.\"\r\nThe fisherman said, \"You will tire out your tongue.\r\nDo you see any signs of my giving in?\r\nPut you back in the pool? Why, you fatuous fool,\r\nI have eaten much smaller and thinner fish.\r\nYou're not salmon or sole, but I think, on the whole,\r\nYou're a fairly respectable dinner-fish.\"\n\r\nThe fisherman's cook tried her hand on the trout\r\nAnd with various herbs she embellished him;\r\nHe was lovely to see, and there isn't a doubt\r\nThat the fisherman's family relished him,\r\nAnd, to prove that they did, both his wife and his kid\r\nDevoured the trout with much eagerness,\r\nAvowing no dish could compare with that fish,\r\nNotwithstanding his singular meagreness.\n\r\nAnd THE MORAL, you'll find, is although it is kind\r\nTo grant favors that people are wishing for,\r\nStill a dinner you'll lack if you chance to throw back\r\nIn the pool little trout that you're fishing for;\r\nIf their pleading you spurn you will certainly learn\r\nThat herbs will deliciously vary 'em:\r\nIt is needless to state that a trout on a plate\r\nBeats several in the aquarium.",

          "The vainest girls in forty states\r\nWere Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates;\r\nThey warbled, slightly off the air,\r\nRomantic German songs,\r\nAnd each of them upon her hair\r\nEmployed the curling tongs,\r\nAnd each with ardor most intense\r\nHer buxom figure laced,\r\nUntil her wilful want of sense\r\nProcured a woeful waist:\r\nFor bound to marry titled mates\r\nWere Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates.\n\r\nYet, truth to tell, the swains were few\r\nOf Gwendolyn (and Gladys, too).\r\nSo morning, afternoon, and night\r\nUpon their sister they\r\nWere wont to vent their selfish spite,\r\nAnd in the rudest way:\r\nFor though her name was Leonore,\r\nThat's neither there nor here,\r\nThey called her Cinderella, for\r\nThe kitchen was her sphere,\r\nSave when the hair she had to do\r\nOf Gwendolyn (and Gladys, too).\n\r\nEach night to dances and to f'tes\r\nWent Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates,\r\nAnd Cinderella watched them go\r\nIn silks and satins clad:\r\nA prince invited them, and so\r\nThey put on all they had!\r\nBut one fine night, as all alone\r\nShe watched the flames leap higher,\r\nA small and stooping fairy crone\r\nStept nimbly from the fire.\r\nSaid she: \"The pride upon me grates\r\nOf Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates.\"\n\r\n\"I'll now,\" she added, with a frown,\r\n\"Call Gwendolyn and Gladys down!\"\r\nAnd, ere your fingers you could snap,\r\nThere stood before the door\r\nNo paltry hired horse and trap,\r\nOh, no!--a coach and four!\r\nAnd Cinderella, fitted out\r\nRegardless of expense,\r\nMade both her sisters look about\r\nLike thirty-seven cents!\r\nThe prince, with one look at her gown,\r\nTurned Gwendolyn and Gladys down!\n\r\nWall-flowers, when thus compared with her,\r\nBoth Gwendolyn and Gladys were.\r\nThe prince but gave them glances hard,\r\nNo gracious word he said;\r\nHe scratched their names from off his card,\r\nAnd wrote hers down instead:\r\nAnd where he would bestow his hand\r\nHe showed them in a trice\r\nBy handing her the kisses, and\r\nTo each of them an ice!\r\nIn sudden need of fire and fur\r\nBoth Gwendolyn and Gladys were.\n\r\nAt ten o'clock, in discontent,\r\nBoth Gwendolyn and Gladys went.\r\nTheir sister stayed till after two,\r\nAnd, with a joy sincere,\r\nThe prince obtained her crystal shoe\r\nBy way of souvenir.\r\n\"Upon the bridal path,\" he cried,\r\n\"We'll reign together! Since\r\nI love you, you must be my bride!\"\r\n(He was no slouch, that prince!)\r\nAnd into sudden languishment\r\nBoth Gwendolyn and Gladys went.\n\n\r\nThe Moral: All the girls on earth\r\nExaggerate their proper worth.\r\nThey think the very shoes they wear\r\nAre worth the average millionaire;\r\nWhereas few pairs in any town\r\nCan be half-sold for half a crown!",
          "She bade me follow to her garden, where\r\nThe mellow sunlight stood as in a cup\r\nBetween the old grey walls; I did not dare\r\nTo raise my face, I did not dare look up,\r\nLest her bright eyes like sparrows should fly in\r\nMy windows of discovery, and shrill \"Sin.\"\n\r\nSo with a downcast mien and laughing voice\r\nI followed, followed the swing of her white dress\r\nThat rocked in a lilt along: I watched the poise\r\nOf her feet as they flew for a space, then paused to press\r\nThe grass deep down with the royal burden of her:\r\nAnd gladly I'd offered my breast to the tread of her.\n\r\n\"I like to see,\" she said, and she crouched her down,\r\nShe sunk into my sight like a settling bird;\r\nAnd her bosom couched in the confines of her gown\r\nLike heavy birds at rest there, softly stirred\r\nBy her measured breaths: \"I like to see,\" said she,\r\n\"The snap-dragon put out his tongue at me.\"\n\r\nShe laughed, she reached her hand out to the flower,\r\nClosing its crimson throat. My own throat in her power\r\nStrangled, my heart swelled up so full\r\nAs if it would burst its wine-skin in my throat,\r\nChoke me in my own crimson. I watched her pull\r\nThe gorge of the gaping flower, till the blood did float\n\r\nOver my eyes, and I was blind - \r\nHer large brown hand stretched over\r\nThe windows of my mind;\r\nAnd there in the dark I did discover\r\nThings I was out to find:\r\nMy Grail, a brown bowl twined\r\nWith swollen veins that met in the wrist,\r\nUnder whose brown the amethyst\r\nI longed to taste. I longed to turn\r\nMy heart's red measure in her cup,\r\nI longed to feel my hot blood burn\r\nWith the amethyst in her cup.\n\r\nThen suddenly she looked up,\r\nAnd I was blind in a tawny-gold day,\r\nTill she took her eyes away.\r\nSo she came down from above\r\nAnd emptied my heart of love.\r\nSo I held my heart aloft\r\nTo the cuckoo that hung like a dove,\r\nAnd she settled soft\n\r\nIt seemed that I and the morning world\r\nWere pressed cup-shape to take this reiver\r\nBird who was weary to have furled\r\nHer wings in us,\r\nAs we were weary to receive her.\n\r\nThis bird, this rich,\r\nSumptuous central grain,\r\nThis mutable witch,\r\nThis one refrain,\r\nThis laugh in the fight,\r\nThis clot of night,\r\nThis core of delight.\n\r\nShe spoke, and I closed my eyes\r\nTo shut hallucinations out.\r\nI echoed with surprise\r\nHearing my mere lips shout\r\nThe answer they did devise.\n\r\nAgain I saw a brown bird hover\r\nOver the flowers at my feet;\r\nI felt a brown bird hover\r\nOver my heart, and sweet\r\nIts shadow lay on my heart.\r\nI thought I saw on the clover\r\nA brown bee pulling apart\r\nThe closed flesh of the clover\r\nAnd burrowing in its heart.\n\r\nShe moved her hand, and again\r\nI felt the brown bird cover\r\nMy heart; and then\r\nThe bird came down on my heart,\r\nAs on a nest the rover\r\nCuckoo comes, and shoves over\r\nThe brim each careful part\r\nOf love, takes possession, and settles her down,\r\nWith her wings and her feathers to drown\r\nThe nest in a heat of love.\n\r\nShe turned her flushed face to me for the glint\r\nOf a moment. \"See,\" she laughed, \"if you also\r\nCan make them yawn.\" I put my hand to the dint\r\nIn the flower's throat, and the flower gaped wide with woe.\r\nShe watched, she went of a sudden intensely still,\r\nShe watched my hand, to see what I would fulfil.\n\r\nI pressed the wretched, throttled flower between\r\nMy fingers, till its head lay back, its fangs\r\nPoised at her. Like a weapon my hand was white and keen,\r\nAnd I held the choked flower-serpent in its pangs\r\nOf mordant anguish, till she ceased to laugh,\r\nUntil her pride's flag, smitten, cleaved down to the staff.\n\r\nShe hid her face, she murmured between her lips\r\nThe low word \"Don't.\" I let the flower fall,\r\nBut held my hand afloat towards the slips\r\nOf blossom she fingered, and my fingers all\r\nPut forth to her: she did not move, nor I,\r\nFor my hand like a snake watched hers, that could not fly.\n\r\nThen I laughed in the dark of my heart, I did exult\r\nLike a sudden chuckling of music. I bade her eyes\r\nMeet mine, I opened her helpless eyes to consult\r\nTheir fear, their shame, their joy that underlies\r\nDefeat in such a battle. In the dark of her eyes\r\nMy heart was fierce to make her laughter rise.\n\r\nTill her dark deeps shook with convulsive thrills, and the dark\r\nOf her spirit wavered like water thrilled with light;\r\nAnd my heart leaped up in longing to plunge its stark\r\nFervour within the pool of her twilight,\r\nWithin her spacious soul, to grope in delight.\n\r\nAnd I do not care, though the large hands of revenge\r\nShall get my throat at last, shall get it soon,\r\nIf the joy that they are searching to avenge\r\nHave risen red on my night as a harvest moon,\r\nWhich even death can only put out for me;\r\nAnd death, I know, is better than not-to-be.",
          "Should man, with microscopic eye,\r\nView the details of Nature's plan,\r\nInto each nook and corner pry,\r\nAnd needlessly the hidden scan?\n\r\nShould he inspect each bud and flow'r,\r\nWith close, unmeant, uncall'd-for look,\r\nAnd, by his analytic pow'r,\r\nDissolve each charm of vale or brook?\n\r\nShould he resolve the rainbow's hues,\r\nInto their prime and simple forms,\r\nAnd thus the charm dispel, unloose,\r\nWhich gladdens us, amid the storms?\n\r\nShould he, with keen, inquiring look,\r\nInsist on knowing, seeing all,\r\nWhich nature made a sealed book\r\nOn this, our strange, terrestrial ball,\n\r\n'Tis hard to draw the line, indeed,\r\nWhen we should pry, and when refrain,\r\nBut science surely has its need\r\nOf knowledge gain'd, and also pain.\n\r\nThe blooming flow'r, the flutt'ring leaf,\r\nHave surely charms we all can tell,\r\nAnd analysing brings to grief,\r\nThe charms we felt, and knew so well.\n\r\nTh' untutor'd savage, roaming wild,\r\nCould view the rainbow in the sky,\r\nAnd, tho' in science but a child,\r\nHe saw with gladden'd heart, and eye.\n\r\nAnd so, I apprehend, that we\r\nShould oft restrain our thoughts and sight,\r\nNor delve too far, nor try to see,\r\nWith deeper, but more painful light.",
          "Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty\r\nA hundred years ago,\r\nAll through the night with lantern bright\r\nThe Watch trudged to and fro,\r\nAnd little boys tucked snug abed\r\nWould wake from dreams to hear -\r\n'Two o' the morning by the clock,\r\nAnd the stars a-shining clear!'\r\nOr, when across the chimney-tops\r\nScreamed shrill a North-East gale,\r\nA faint and shaken voice would shout,\r\n'Three! And a storm of hail!'",
          "(for Gerry)\n\n\r\nWhen May has spent its little song,\r\nAnd richer comes the June,\r\nThrough former eyes the heart will long\r\nFor May again in tune;\r\nThough large with promise hope may be,\r\nBy future visions cast,\r\nOur memoried thoughts will yearn to see\r\nThe happy little past.\n\r\nAnd you, my loyal little friend,\r\n(From May to June you go),\r\nWhat years of loyalty attend\r\nGreat comradeship we know;\r\nYet joy have me in place of tears\r\nTo see your road depart,\r\nFor whether east or west your years,\r\nA friend stays home at heart.\n\r\nThen gladly let the Springtime pass\r\nAnd Summer in its wake;\r\nAhead are fields of flower and grass\r\nAll fragrant for your sake:\r\nWith hearts of joy we say farewell,\r\nWith laughter, wave and nod,\r\nIt's always May for us who dwell\r\nIn seasons close to God.",

          "At evening when the aspens rustled soft\r\nAnd the last blackbird by the hedge-nest laughed,\r\nAnd through the leaves the moon's unmeaning face\r\nLooked, and then rose in dark-blue leafless space;\r\nWatching the trees and moon she could not bear\r\nThe silence and the presence everywhere.\r\nThe blackbird called the silence and it came\r\nClosing and closing round like smoke round flame.\r\nInto her heart it crept and the heart was numb,\r\nEven wishes died, and all but fear was dumb--\r\nFear and its phantoms. Then the trees were enlarged,\r\nAnd from their roundness unguessed shapes emerged,\r\nOr no shape but the image of her fear\r\nCreeping forth from her mind and hovering near.\r\nIf a bat flitted it was an evil thing;\r\nSadder the trees grew with every shadowy wing--\r\nTheir shape enlarged, their arms quivered, their thought\r\nStirring in the leaves a silent anguish wrought.\r\n\"What are they thinking of, the evil trees,\r\nNod-nodding, standing in malignant ease?\r\nSomething against man's mortal heart was sworn\r\nOnce, when their dark Powers were conceived and born;\r\nAnd in such fading or such lightless hours\r\nThe world is delivered to these plotting Powers.\"\r\nNo physical swift blow she dreaded, not\r\nLightning's quick mercy; but her heart grew hot\r\nAnd cold and hot with uncomprehended sense\r\nOf an assassin spiritual influence\r\nMoving in the unmoving trees....\r\nTill, as she stared,\r\nHer eyes turned cowards at last, and no more dared.\r\nYet could she never rise and shut the door:\r\nPerhaps those Powers would batter at the door,\r\nAnd that were madness. So right through the house\r\nShe set the doors all wide when she could arouse\r\nThe body's energy to serve the mind.\r\nThen the air would move, and any little wind\r\nWould cleanse awhile the darkness and diminish\r\nHer fear, and the dumb shadow-war would finish.\n\r\nBut it was not the trees, the birds, the moon;\r\nBirds cease, months fly, green seasons wither soon:\r\nNature was constant all the seasons through,\r\nSinister, watchful, and a thick cloud drew\r\nOver the mind when its simplicity\r\nChallenged what seemed with thought of what must be....\r\nShe wondered, seeing how a child could play\r\nLightly in a shady field all day:\r\nFor in that golden, brief, benignant weather\r\nWhen spring and summer calling run together\r\nAnd the sun's fresh and hot, she saw deep guile\r\nIn the sweetness of that unconditioned smile.\r\nSweetness not sweetness was but indifference\r\nOr wantonness disguised, to her grave sense;\r\nAnd if she could have seen the things she felt\r\nShe'd looked for darkness, and lit shapes that knelt\r\nAppealing, unregarded, at a high\r\nAltar uprising from the pit to the sky....\r\nHad the trees consciousness, with flowers and clouds\r\nAnd winds that hung like thin clouds in the woods,\r\nAnd stars and silence:--had they each a mind\r\nBending on hers, clear eyes on her eyes blind?\r\nIn the green dense heights--elm, oak, ash, yew or beech\r\nShe scarce saw--was there not a brain in each,\r\nAn undiscovered centre of quick nerves\r\nBy which (like man) the tree lives, masters, serves,\r\nWaxes and wanes? Oppressed her mind would shrink\r\nFrom thought, and into her trembling body sink.\n\r\nSomething of this had childhood taught her when\r\nSickly she lay and peered again and again\r\nAt gray skies and white skies and void bright blue,\r\nAnd watched the sun the bare town-tree boughs through,\r\nAnd then through leafy boughs and once more bare.\r\nOr in the west country's heavy hill-drawn air\r\nHad felt the green grass pushing within her veins,\r\nTangling and strangling: and the warm spring rains\r\nTapping all night upon her childish head:\r\nShe shivered, lying lonely on her bed,\r\nWith all that life all round and she so weak,\r\nLonging to speak--yet what was there to speak?\r\nAnd as she grew and health came and love came\r\nAnd life was happier, happier, still the same\r\nInhuman spirit rose whenever she\r\nHeld in her thoughts more than her eyes could see.\r\nBehind the happiest hours the dark cloud hung\r\nDistant or nearing, and its dullness flung\r\nOn the south meadows of her thought, the fairest\r\nShrinking in shadow; aspirations rarest\r\nFalling, like shot birds in a reedy fen,\r\nSlain by the old Enemy of men.\r\nLife ebbed while men strove for the means of life;\r\nThe grudging earth turned labour into strife.\r\nThe moving hosts within the heavy clod\r\nSeemed infinite in malice; frost and flood,\r\nSeason and inter-season, were conspired\r\nIn smiling or sour mockery; and untired\r\nAnd undelighted, man scratched and scratched on,\r\nAnd what he did, by Nature was undone.\r\nShe saw men twisted more than rocks or trees,\r\nBruised, numbed, by age and labour and the disease\r\nOf labour in the cold fields; women worn\r\nBy many child-bearings, and their self-scorn\r\nBecause of time and their lost woman's powers.\r\nBitter was Nature to women; for those hours\r\nOf the spirit's and the body's first delight\r\nPassed soon, and the long day, evening, night\r\nOf life uncherished; bitterest when even\r\nThat brief hour was denied, of dancing heaven,\r\nDewy love, and fulfilled desires.\r\nBut age\r\nOf all ills made her pity and anger rage.\r\nTo see and smell the calm months bud and bloom,\r\nApril's first warmth, June's hues and slow perfume,\r\nThe sweetness drifting by in those long hours\r\nWhile, out of her she nursed, the vital powers\r\nWere pressed by pain and pressed by pain renewed,\r\nTill, closing the life-long vicissitude,\r\nCame starving death with full-heaped summer, and\r\nWrung the last pangs that spirit could withstand ...\r\nOr to see age in its prison slowly freeze\r\nWith impotence more disastrous than disease,\r\nWhile trees flowered on, or all the winter through\r\nUpheld brave arms and with spring flowered anew\r\nAbove those living graves and graves of the dead;--\r\n'Twas all such bitterness, but she nothing said.\r\nShe saw men as courageous boats that sailed\r\nOn all the seas, and some a far port hailed\r\nPerhaps to sail again, or anchor there\r\nForever; some would quietly disappear\r\nIn stormless waters, and some in storms be broken\r\nAnd all be hidden and no clear meaning spoken,\r\nNor any trace upon the waters linger.\r\nWhere the boat went the wind with hasty finger,\r\nSavage and sly as aught of land could be,\r\nErased the little wrinkling of the sea.\r\nO, in such enmity was man enisled,\r\nSuch loneliness, by foolish shades beguiled,\r\nThat it was bravery to see and live,\r\nBut cowardice to see and to forgive,\r\nThe wrong of evil, the wrong of death to life,\r\nThe defeat of innocence, the waste of strife,--\r\nThe heavy ills of time, injustice, pain--\r\nIn field and forest and flood rose huge and plain,\r\nBrushing her mind with darkness, till she thought\r\nNot with her brain, but all her nerves were wrought\r\nInto an apprehension burning strong,\r\nUnslackening, of mortality's old wrong.\r\nBut if her eyes she raised to those clear lonely\r\nAltitudes of stars and ether only,\r\nHer eyes fell and rebuked her as forbidden\r\nWith human mind to question what was hidden.\r\nAt summer dusk the broad moon rising high\r\nPut gentleness in the vast strength of the sky,\r\nEasing its weight; or the hot summer sun\r\nMade noonday kind, and the hours lightly run.\r\nBut in those blazing midnights of the stars\r\nGathered and brightening for immortal wars\r\nWith spears and darts and arrows of sharp light,\r\nShe read the indifference of the infinite,\r\nThe high strife flashing through eternity\r\nWhile on the earth stared mortals but as she.\n\r\nO 'twas a living world that rose around\r\nAnd in her sentience burned a hollow wound.\r\nSuch easy brightness as the poets see,\r\nOr easy gloom, or hues of faerie,\r\nShe never saw, but into her own heart peered\r\nTo find what spirit indeed it was she feared:--\r\nWhether in antique days a divine foe\r\nSprung branchlike from dense woods had wrought her woe;\r\nWhether in antique days a pagan rite\r\n(Herself a pagan still) unfilmed her sight\r\nAnd taught her secrets never to be forgot,\r\nAnd by man's generation pardoned not....\r\nThe same blood in ancestral veins ran fleet\r\nAs now made hers a road for pain's quick feet.\r\nInto the marrow of her hidden life\r\nHad poured the agony of their termless strife\r\nWith immaterial and material things;\r\nAnd as a bird an unlearned music sings\r\nBecause a million generations sang,\r\nSo in her breast the old alarum rang,\r\nSo the old sorrowfulness in her thought\r\nRenewed, and apprehensions all untaught;\r\nAs if indeed a creature primitive\r\nStill did she in the world's dim morning live,\r\nThat wanted human warmth and gentleness\r\nTo make its solitude a little less.\n\r\nKindness gave solitude the lovely light\r\nShe loved, and made less terrible black midnight.\r\nEven as a bird its unlearned music pours\r\nThough windows all be blind and shut the doors,\r\nAnd sings on still though no faint sound be heard\r\nBut wind and leaves and another lonely bird:\r\nSo poured she untaught kindness all around\r\nAnd in that human music comfort found--\r\nMusic her own and music heard from others,\r\nPrime music of all lovers, children, mothers,\r\nPrecarious music between all men sounding,\r\nThe horror of silent and dark Powers confounding.\r\nSinging that music she could bravely live;\r\nHearing it, find less sorrow to forgive.",
          "Though black the night, I know upon the sky,\r\nA little paler now, if clouds were none,\r\nThe stars would be. Husht now the thickets lie,\r\nAnd now the birds are moving one by one,, \r\nA note, and now from bush to bush it goes, \r\nA prelude, now victorious light along\r\nThe west will come till every bramble glows\r\nWith wash of sunlit dew shaken in song.\r\nShaken in song;O heart, be ready now,\r\nCold in your night, be ready now to sing.\r\nDawn as it wakes the sleeping bird on bough\r\nShall summon you to instant reckoning,, \r\nShe is your dawn, O heart,, sing, till the night\r\nOf death shall come, the gospel of her light.\n",
          "In front of the sombre mountains, a faint, lost ribbon of rainbow;\r\nAnd between us and it, the thunder;\r\nAnd down below in the green wheat, the labourers\r\nStand like dark stumps, still in the green wheat.\n\r\nYou are near to me, and your naked feet in their sandals,\r\nAnd through the scent of the balcony's naked timber\r\nI distinguish the scent of your hair: so now the limber\r\nLightning falls from heaven.\n\r\nAdown the pale-green glacier river floats\r\nA dark boat through the gloom - and whither?\r\nThe thunder roars. But still we have each other!\r\nThe naked lightnings in the heavens dither\r\nAnd disappear - what have we but each other?\r\nThe boat has gone.\n\r\nICKING",
          "Who is that woman, Philip, standing there\r\nBefore the mirror doing up her hair?\n\r\nYou're dreaming, Phoebe, or the morning light\r\nMixing and mingling with the dying night\r\nMakes shapes out of the darkness, and you see\r\nSome dream-remembered phantasy maybe.\n\r\nYet it grows clearer with the growing day;\r\nAnd in the cold dawn light her hair is grey:\r\nHer lifted arms are naught but bone: her hands\r\nWhite withered claws that fumble as she stands\r\nTrying to pin that wisp into its place.\r\nO Philip, I must look upon her face\r\nThere in the mirror. Nay, but I will rise\r\nAnd peep over her shoulder ... Oh, the eyes\r\nThat burn out from that face of skin and bone,\r\nSearching my very marrow, are my own.\n\n",
          "Who are these? Why sit they here in twilight?\r\nWherefore rock they, purgatorial shadows,\r\nDrooping tongues from jaws that slob their relish,\r\nBaring teeth that leer like skulls' tongues wicked?\r\nStroke on stroke of pain,--but what slow panic,\r\nGouged these chasms round their fretted sockets?\r\nEver from their hair and through their hand palms\r\nMisery swelters. Surely we have perished\r\nSleeping, and walk hell; but who these hellish?\n\r\n --These are men whose minds the Dead have ravished.\r\nMemory fingers in their hair of murders,\r\nMultitudinous murders they once witnessed.\r\nWading sloughs of flesh these helpless wander,\r\nTreading blood from lungs that had loved laughter.\r\nAlways they must see these things and hear them,\r\nBatter of guns and shatter of flying muscles,\r\nCarnage incomparable and human squander\r\nRucked too thick for these men's extrication.\n\r\nTherefore still their eyeballs shrink tormented\r\nBack into their brains, because on their sense\r\nSunlight seems a bloodsmear; night comes blood-black;\r\nDawn breaks open like a wound that bleeds afresh\r\n --Thus their heads wear this hilarious, hideous,\r\nAwful falseness of set-smiling corpses.\r\n --Thus their hands are plucking at each other;\r\nPicking at the rope-knouts of their scourging;\r\nSnatching after us who smote them, brother,\r\nPawing us who dealt them war and madness.",
          "Black trees against an orange sky,\r\nTrees that the wind shook terribly,\r\nLike a harsh spume along the road,\r\nQuavering up like withered arms,\r\nWrithing like streams, like twisted charms\r\nOf hot lead flung in snow. Below\r\nThe iron ice stung like a goad,\r\nSlashing the torn shoes from my feet,\r\nAnd all the air was bitter sleet.\n\r\nAnd all the land was cramped with snow,\r\nSteel-strong and fierce and glimmering wan,\r\nLike pale plains of obsidian.\r\n-- And yet I strove -- and I was fire\r\nAnd ice -- and fire and ice were one\r\nIn one vast hunger of desire.\r\nA dim desire, of pleasant places,\r\nAnd lush fields in the summer sun,\r\nAnd logs aflame, and walls, and faces,\r\n-- And wine, and old ambrosial talk,\r\nA golden ball in fountains dancing,\r\nAnd unforgotten hands. (Ah, God,\r\nI trod them down where I have trod,\r\nAnd they remain, and they remain,\r\nEtched in unutterable pain,\r\nLoved lips and faces now apart,\r\nThat once were closer than my heart --\r\nIn agony, in agony,\r\nAnd horribly a part of me....\r\nFor Lethe is for no man set,\r\nAnd in Hell may no man forget.)\n\r\nAnd there were flowers, and jugs, bright-glancing,\r\nAnd old Italian swords -- and looks,\r\nA moment's glance of fire, of fire,\r\nSpiring, leaping, flaming higher,\r\nInto the intense, the cloudless blue,\r\nUntil two souls were one, and flame,\r\nAnd very flesh, and yet the same!\r\nAs if all springs were crushed anew\r\nInto one globed drop of dew!\r\nBut for the most I thought of heat,\r\nDesiring greatly.... Hot white sand\r\nThe lazy body lies at rest in,\r\nOr sun-dried, scented grass to nest in,\r\nAnd fires, innumerable fires,\r\nGreat fagots hurling golden gyres\r\nOf sparks far up, and the red heart\r\nIn sea-coals, crashing as they part\r\nTo tiny flares, and kindling snapping,\r\nBunched sticks that burst their string and wrapping\r\nAnd fall like jackstraws; green and blue\r\nThe evil flames of driftwood too,\r\nAnd heavy, sullen lumps of coke\r\nWith still, fierce heat and ugly smoke....\r\n... And then the vision of his face,\r\nAnd theirs, all theirs, came like a sword,\r\nThrice, to the heart -- and as I fell\r\nI thought I saw a light before.\n\r\nI woke. My hands were blue and sore,\r\nTorn on the ice. I scarcely felt\r\nThe frozen sleet begin to melt\r\nUpon my face as I breathed deeper,\r\nBut lay there warmly, like a sleeper\r\nWho shifts his arm once, and moans low,\r\nAnd then sinks back to night. Slow, slow,\r\nAnd still as Death, came Sleep and Death\r\nAnd looked at me with quiet breath.\r\nUnbending figures, black and stark\r\nAgainst the intense deeps of the dark.\r\nTall and like trees. Like sweet and fire\r\nRest crept and crept along my veins,\r\nGently. And there were no more pains....\n\r\nWas it not better so to lie?\r\nThe fight was done. Even gods tire\r\nOf fighting.... My way was the wrong.\r\nNow I should drift and drift along\r\nTo endless quiet, golden peace...\r\nAnd let the tortured body cease.\n\r\nAnd then a light winked like an eye.\r\n... And very many miles away\r\nA girl stood at a warm, lit door,\r\nHolding a lamp. Ray upon ray\r\nIt cloaked the snow with perfect light.\r\nAnd where she was there was no night\r\nNor could be, ever. God is sure,\r\nAnd in his hands are things secure.\r\nIt is not given me to trace\r\nThe lovely laughter of that face,\r\nLike a clear brook most full of light,\r\nOr olives swaying on a height,\r\nSo silver they have wings, almost;\r\nLike a great word once known and lost\r\nAnd meaning all things. Nor her voice\r\nA happy sound where larks rejoice,\r\nHer body, that great loveliness,\r\nThe tender fashion of her dress,\r\nI may not paint them.\r\nThese I see,\r\nBlazing through all eternity,\r\nA fire-winged sign, a glorious tree!\n\r\nShe stood there, and at once I knew\r\nThe bitter thing that I must do.\r\nThere could be no surrender now;\r\nThough Sleep and Death were whispering low.\r\nMy way was wrong. So. Would it mend\r\nIf I shrank back before the end?\r\nAnd sank to death and cowardice?\r\nNo, the last lees must be drained up,\r\nBase wine from an ignoble cup;\r\n(Yet not so base as sleek content\r\nWhen I had shrunk from punishment)\n\r\nThe wretched body strain anew!\r\nLife was a storm to wander through.\r\nI took the wrong way. Good and well,\r\nAt least my feet sought out not Hell!\r\nThough night were one consuming flame\r\nI must go on for my base aim,\r\nAnd so, perhaps, make evil grow\r\nTo something clean by agony...\r\nAnd reach that light upon the snow...\r\nAnd touch her dress at last...\r\nSo, so,\r\nI crawled. I could not speak or see\r\nSave dimly. The ice glared like fire,\r\nA long bright Hell of choking cold,\r\nAnd each vein was a tautened wire,\r\nThrobbing with torture -- and I crawled.\r\nMy hands were wounds.\r\nSo I attained\r\nThe second Hell. The snow was stained\r\nI thought, and shook my head at it\r\nHow red it was! Black tree-roots clutched\r\nAnd tore -- and soon the snow was smutched\r\nAnew; and I lurched babbling on,\r\nAnd then fell down to rest a bit,\r\nAnd came upon another Hell...\r\nLoose stones that ice made terrible,\r\nThat rolled and gashed men as they fell.\r\nI stumbled, slipped... and all was gone\r\nThat I had gained. Once more I lay\r\nBefore the long bright Hell of ice.\r\nAnd still the light was far away.\r\nThere was red mist before my eyes\r\nOr I could tell you how I went\r\nAcross the swaying firmament,\r\nA glittering torture of cold stars,\r\nAnd how I fought in Titan wars...\r\nAnd died... and lived again upon\r\nThe rack... and how the horses strain\r\nWhen their red task is nearly done....\n\r\nI only know that there was Pain,\r\nInfinite and eternal Pain.\r\nAnd that I fell -- and rose again.\n\r\nSo she was walking in the road.\r\nAnd I stood upright like a man,\r\nOnce, and fell blind, and heard her cry...\r\nAnd then there came long agony.\r\nThere was no pain when I awoke,\r\nNo pain at all. Rest, like a goad,\r\nSpurred my eyes open -- and light broke\r\nUpon them like a million swords:\r\nAnd she was there. There are no words.\n\r\nHeaven is for a moment's span.\r\nAnd ever.\r\nSo I spoke and said,\r\n\"My honor stands up unbetrayed,\r\nAnd I have seen you. Dear...\"\r\nSharp pain\r\nClosed like a cloak....\r\n I moaned and died.\n\r\nHere, even here, these things remain.\r\nI shall draw nearer to her side.\n\r\nOh dear and laughing, lost to me,\r\nHidden in grey Eternity,\r\nI shall attain, with burning feet,\r\nTo you and to the mercy-seat!\r\nThe ages crumble down like dust,\r\nDark roses, deviously thrust\r\nAnd scattered in sweet wine -- but I,\r\nI shall lift up to you my cry,\r\nAnd kiss your wet lips presently\r\nBeneath the ever-living Tree.\n\r\nThis in my heart I keep for goad!\r\nSomewhere, in Heaven she walks that road.\r\nSomewhere... in Heaven... she walks... that... road....\n",

          "(Shortly before departing for the theater of war)\n\r\nfor Peter Scher\n\r\nBefore dying I am making my poem.\r\nQuiet, comrades, don't disturb me.\r\nWe are going off to war.Death is our cement.\r\nIf only my beloved did not shed these tears for me.\r\nWhat am I doing.I go gladly.\r\nMother is crying.One must be made of iron.\r\nThe sun sinks to the horizon.\r\nSoon I shall be tossed into a gentle mass grave.\r\nIn the sky the fine red of evening is burning.\r\nPerhaps in thrirteen days I'll be dead.",
          "We are the smirched.Queen Honor is the spotless.\r\nWe slept thro' wars where Honor could not sleep.\r\nWe were faint-hearted.Honor was full-valiant.\r\nWe kept a silence Honor could not keep.\n\r\nYet this late day we make a song to praise her.\r\nWe, codeless, will yet vindicate her code.\r\nShe who was mighty, walks with us, the beggars.\r\nThe merchants drive her out upon the road.\n\r\nShe makes a throne of sod beside our campfire.\r\nWe give the maiden-queen our rags and tears.\r\nA battered, rascal guard have rallied round her,\r\nTo keep her safe until the better years.",
          "Evening comes with moonshine and silky darkness.\r\nThe roads become weary.The narrow world widens.\r\nWinds of opium move in and out of the field.\r\nI widen my eyes like silver wings.\r\nI feel as though my body were the whole earth.\r\nThe city lights up: thousands of street lamps sway.\r\nNow the sky also piously enkindles its candlelight.\r\n...Huge above everything my human face wanders - ",
          "Houses stand stiffly next to their fences.\r\nLet your eyes, last sparrows, flutter.\r\nBluebottles alight on your face.\r\nDon't you, Kuno, feel the eternal mills - \r\nThe unfeeling one bores holes in your head.\r\nLook once more at the moon, the mustard-pot murderer.",
          "The heat sticks closely to the gun and to the hand.\r\nIt pricks the eyes.Nothing remained forgotten.\r\nThe troops stepped, half drunk, into the fire.\r\nThe non-coms stand rigidly in front.\r\nThe glaring earth is a dead carousel.\r\nNothing stirs.No one drops down.No streaked sky flies.\r\nOnly rarely a hoarse barking tears apart the blue sow\r\nWhich lies on the stone barracks.\r\nNow the army leaves me alone.\r\nWho still pays attention to me.They got used\r\nTo my strange civilian eyes long ago.\r\nOn maneuvers I am half dreaming,\r\nAnd as we march I compose poems.\n\r\nBut war comes.There was peace too long.\r\nNo more good times.Trumpets screech\r\nDeep into your heart.And all the nights are burning.\r\nYou freeze in tents.You're hot.You're hungry.\r\nYou drown.Explode.Bleed to death.Fields rattle noisily.\r\nChurch towers fall.Flames in the distance.\r\nWinds twitch.Large cities crash.\r\nOn the horizon cannons thunder.\r\nAround the hill tops a white vapor rises,\r\nAnd grenades burst at your head.",
          "(Dedicated to a clown)\n\r\nMany days tread upon human animals,\r\nIn gentle oceans hunger-sharks fly.\r\nHeads, beers glisten in coffee-houses.\r\nGirls' screams shred on a man.\r\nThunderstorms come crashing down.Forest winds darken.\r\nWomen knead prayers in skinny hands:\r\nMay the Lord God send an angel.\r\nA shred of moonlight shimmers in the sewers.\r\nReaders of books crouch quietly on their bodies.\r\nAn evening dips the world in lilac lye.\r\nThe trunk of a body floats in a windshield.\r\nFrom deep in the brain its eyes sink.",

river and peak and plain\r\nPassed like a dream I slept to lose and I waked to dream again.\n\r\nRiver and plain and mighty peak - and who could stand unawed?\r\nAs their summits blazed, he could stand undazed at the foot of the throne of God.\r\nNorth, aye, North, through a land accurst, shunned by the scouring brutes,\r\nAnd all I heard was my own harsh word and the whine of the malamutes,\r\nTill at last I came to a cabin squat, built in the side of a hill,\r\nAnd I burst in the door, and there on the floor, frozen to death, lay Bill.\n\r\nIce, white ice, like a winding-sheet, sheathing each smoke-grimed wall;\r\nIce on the stove-pipe, ice on the bed, ice gleaming over all;\r\nSparkling ice on the dead man's chest, glittering ice in his hair,\r\nIce on his fingers, ice in his heart, ice in his glassy stare;\r\nHard as a log and trussed like a frog, with his arms and legs outspread.\r\nI gazed at the coffin I'd brought for him, and I gazed at the gruesome dead,\r\nAnd at last I spoke: \"Bill liked his joke; but still, goldarn his eyes,\r\nA man had ought to consider his mates in the way he goes and dies.\"\n\r\nHave you ever stood in an Arctic hut in the shadow of the Pole,\r\nWith a little coffin six by three and a grief you can't control?\r\nHave you ever sat by a frozen corpse that looks at you with a grin,\r\nAnd that seems to say: \"You may try all day, but you'll never jam me in\"?\r\nI'm not a man of the quitting kind, but I never felt so blue\r\nAs I sat there gazing at that stiff and studying what I'd do.\r\nThen I rose and I kicked off the husky dogs that were nosing round about,\r\nAnd I lit a roaring fire in the stove, and I started to thaw Bill out.\n\r\nWell, I thawed and thawed for thirteen days, but it didn't seem no good;\r\nHis arms and legs stuck out like pegs, as if they was made of wood.\r\nTill at last I said: \"It ain't no use - he's froze too hard to thaw;\r\nHe's obstinate, and he won't lie straight, so I guess I got to - SAW.\"\r\nSo I sawed off poor Bill's arms and legs, and I laid him snug and straight\r\nIn the little coffin he picked hisself, with the dinky silver plate;\r\nAnd I came nigh near to shedding a tear as I nailed him safely down;\r\nThen I stowed him away in my Yukon sleigh, and I started back to town.\n\r\nSo I buried him as the contract was in a narrow grave and deep,\r\nAnd there he's waiting the Great Clean-up, when the Judgment sluice-heads sweep;\r\nAnd I smoke my pipe and I meditate in the light of the Midnight Sun,\r\nAnd sometimes I wonder if they WAS, the awful things I done.\r\nAnd as I sit and the parson talks, expounding of the Law,\r\nI often think of poor old Bill - AND HOW HARD HE WAS TO SAW.",

          "Thou dost not fly, thou art not perched,\r\n The air is all around:\r\nWhat is it that can keep thee set,\r\n From falling to the ground?\r\nThe concentration of thy mind\r\n Supports thee in the air;\r\nAs thou dost watch the small young birds,\r\n With such a deadly care.\n\r\nMy mind has such a hawk as thou,\r\n It is an evil mood;\r\nIt comes when there's no cause for grief,\r\n And on my joys doth brood.\r\nThen do I see my life in parts;\r\n The earth receives my bones,\r\nThe common air absorbs my mind -\r\n It knows not flowers from stones.\n",
          "Old father Time, his cruel scythe\r\n Has swung full oft around,\r\nSince last the merry Christmas, bells\r\n Rang out their cheerful sound.\r\nWith cruel vigor he has held\r\n His great, impartial sway,\r\nAnd many thousands mown to earth,\r\n Who saw last Christmas day.\n\r\nFor some have left this world for aye,\r\n Who dwelt with us last year;\r\nGlad voices heard amongst us then,\r\n We never more shall hear.\r\nBut still we'll build our Christmas fires,\r\n And sing our Christmas songs,\r\nAnd for one day forget our griefs,\r\n Our failures and our wrongs.\n\r\nThen ring, ye joyful bells, ring out;\r\n Ye crashing cymbals fall;\r\nAnd for old Christmas, hale and stout,\r\n Sound up, ye harps and all.\r\nLet music's loud and sweetest strain\r\n Beat from our hearts each ill;\r\nLet thoughts of those assuage our pain,\r\n Who are around us still.\n\r\nOh, winsome maid, oh, hearty youth,\r\n I urge you on to glee,\r\nFor, in your innocence and truth,\r\n You all are dear to me.\r\nNor youth, nor age should cherish gloom,\r\n And voices oft should sing,\r\nSo give the gladsome voices room,\r\n And let the joy-bells ring.",

          "I have been so great a lover: filled my days\r\nSo proudly with the splendour of Love's praise,\r\nThe pain, the calm, and the astonishment,\r\nDesire illimitable, and still content,\r\nAnd all dear names men use, to cheat despair,\r\nFor the perplexed and viewless streams that bear\r\nOur hearts at random down the dark of life.\r\nNow, ere the unthinking silence on that strife\r\nSteals down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far,\r\nMy night shall be remembered for a star\r\nThat outshone all the suns of all men's days.\r\nShall I not crown them with immortal praise\r\nWhom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me\r\nHigh secrets, and in darkness knelt to see\r\nThe inenarrable godhead of delight?\r\nLove is a flame; we have beaconed the world's night.\r\nA city: and we have built it, these and I.\r\nAn emperor: we have taught the world to die.\r\nSo, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,\r\nAnd the high cause of Love's magnificence,\r\nAnd to keep loyalties young, I'll write those names\r\nGolden for ever, eagles, crying flames,\r\nAnd set them as a banner, that men may know,\r\nTo dare the generations, burn, and blow\r\nOut on the wind of Time, shining and streaming. . . .\r\nThese I have loved:\r\n White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,\r\nRinged with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;\r\nWet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong crust\r\nOf friendly bread; and many-tasting food;\r\nRainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;\r\nAnd radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;\r\nAnd flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,\r\nDreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;\r\nThen, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon\r\nSmooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss\r\nOf blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is\r\nShining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen\r\nUnpassioned beauty of a great machine;\r\nThe benison of hot water; furs to touch;\r\nThe good smell of old clothes; and other such,\r\nThe comfortable smell of friendly fingers,\r\nHair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingers\r\nAbout dead leaves and last year's ferns. . . .\r\n Dear names,\r\nAnd thousand other throng to me! Royal flames;\r\nSweet water's dimpling laugh from tap or spring;\r\nHoles in the ground; and voices that do sing;\r\nVoices in laughter, too; and body's pain,\r\nSoon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train;\r\nFirm sands; the little dulling edge of foam\r\nThat browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;\r\nAnd washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold\r\nGraveness of iron; moist black earthen mould;\r\nSleep; and high places; footprints in the dew;\r\nAnd oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;\r\nAnd new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass;\r\nAll these have been my loves. And these shall pass,\r\nWhatever passes not, in the great hour,\r\nNor all my passion, all my prayers, have power\r\nTo hold them with me through the gate of Death.\r\nThey'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath,\r\nBreak the high bond we made, and sell Love's trust\r\nAnd sacramented covenant to the dust.\r\nOh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake,\r\nAnd give what's left of love again, and make\r\nNew friends, now strangers. . . .\r\n But the best I've known,\r\nStays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blown\r\nAbout the winds of the world, and fades from brains\r\nOf living men, and dies.\r\n Nothing remains.\n\r\nO dear my loves, O faithless, once again\r\nThis one last gift I give: that after men\r\nShall know, and later lovers, far-removed,\r\nPraise you, \"All these were lovely\"; say, \"He loved.\"\n\n\n",

And radiant bands,\r\nThe gracious presence of friendly hands,\r\nHelp the blind one, the glad one, who stumbles and strays,\r\nStretching wavering hands, up, up, through the praise\r\nOf a myriad silver trumpets, through cries,\r\nTo all glory, to all gladness, to the infinite height,\r\nTo the gracious, the unmoving, the mother eyes,\r\nAnd the laughter, and the lips, of light.",

Without thee, love,\r\nMy soul sinks down like a frightened dove.",

It grieved my soul,\r\nIt started a grief within a grief,\r\nTo think their case was beyond relief \r\nThey could not go flying about in search\r\nOf their nest again, nor find a perch.\r\nThey must brood where they fell in mulch and mire,\r\nTrusting feathers and inward fire\r\nTill daylight made it safe for a flyer.\r\nMy greater grief was by so much reduced\r\nAs I though of them without nest or roost.\r\nThat was how that grief started to melt.\r\nThey tell me the cottage where we dwelt,\r\nIts wind-torn thatch goes now unmended;\r\nIts life of hundred of years has ended\r\nBy letting the rain I knew outdoors\r\nIn on to the upper chamber floors.",

Now has Fortune dealt\n\r\nMore kindly with me: once again I know\r\nThe drowsy languor of the afternoons:\r\nThe soft white clouds: the may-tree's whiter snow:\r\nThe star-bound evenings, and the ivory moons.\r\nMy heart, dear God! leaps up till it is pain\r\nWith thanks to Thee that I am here again.\n\r\n London.",
          "When I came home from wanderings\r\nIn a tall chattering ship,\r\nI thought a hundred happy things,\r\nOf people, places, and such things\r\nAs I came sailing home.\n\r\nThe tall ship moved how slowly on\r\nWith me and hundreds more,\r\nThat thought not then of wanderings,\r\nBut of unwhispered, longed-for things,\r\nFamiliar things of home.\n\r\nFor not in miles seemed other lands\r\nFar off, but in long years\r\nAs we came near to England then;\r\nEven the tall ship heard secret things\r\nAs she moved trembling home.\n\r\nIt was at dawn. The chattering ship\r\nWas strangely hushed; faint mist\r\nCrept everywhere, and we crept on,\r\nAnd every eye was creeping on\r\nThe mist, as we moved home....\n\r\nUntil we saw, far, very far,\r\nOr dreamed we saw, her cliffs,\r\nAnd thought of sweet, intolerable things,\r\nOf England--dark, unwhispered things,\r\nSuch things, as we crept home.",
          "Now the long-bearded chilly-fingered winter\r\nOver the green fields sweeps his cloak and leaves\r\nIts whiteness there. It caught on the wild trees,\r\nShook whiteness on the hedges and left bare\r\nSouth-sloping corners and south-fronting smooth\r\nBarks of tall beeches swaying 'neath their whiteness\r\nSo gently that the whiteness does not fall.\r\nThe ash copse shows all white between gray poles,\r\nThe oaks spread arms to catch the wandering snow.\r\nBut the yews--I wondered to see their dark all white,\r\nTo see the soft flakes fallen on those grave deeps,\r\nLying there, not burnt up by the yews' slow fire.\r\nCould Time so whiten all the trembling senses,\r\nThe youth, the fairness, the all-challenging strength,\r\nAnd load even Love's grave deeps with his barren snows?\r\nEven so. And what remains?\r\nThe hills of thought\r\nThat shape Time's snows and melt them and lift up\r\nGreen and unchanging to the wandering stars.",

And I went on.\n\r\nFor if my echoing footfall slept,\r\nSoon a far whispering there'd be\r\nOf a little lonely wind that crept\r\nFrom tree to tree, and distantly\r\nFollowed me, followed me. . . .\n\r\nBut the blue vaporous end of day\r\nBrought peace, and pursuit baffled quite,\r\nWhere between pine-woods dipped the way.\r\nI turned, slipped in and out of sight.\r\nI trod as quiet as the night.\n\r\nThe pine-boles kept perpetual hush;\r\nAnd in the boughs wind never swirled.\r\nI found a flowering lowly bush,\r\nAnd bowed, slid in, and sighed and curled,\r\nHidden at rest from all the world.\n\r\nSafe! I was safe, and glad, I knew!\r\nYet, with cold heart and cold wet brows\r\nI lay. And the dark fell. . . . There grew\r\nMeward a sound of shaken boughs;\r\nAnd ceased, above my intricate house;\n\r\nAnd silence, silence, silence found me. . . .\r\nI felt the unfaltering movement creep\r\nAmong the leaves. They shed around me\r\nCalm clouds of scent, that I did weep;\r\nAnd stroked my face. I fell asleep.",

The world sped fast;\r\nBehind me, ever rolled a pregnant past.\r\nA present came equipped with lore to learn.\r\nArt, science, letters, in their turn,\r\nEach one allured me with its treasures vast;\r\nAnd I staked all for wisdom, till at last\r\nThou cam'st and taught my soul anew to yearn.\r\nI had not dreamed that I could turn away\r\nFrom all that men with brush and pen had wrought;\r\nBut ever since that memorable day\r\nWhen to my heart the truth of love was brought,\r\nI have been wholly yielded to its sway,\r\nAnd had no room for any other thought.",

          " Whenever I walk to Suffern along the Erie track\r\n I go by a poor old farmhouse with its shingles broken and black.\r\n I suppose I've passed it a hundred times, but I always stop for a minute\r\n And look at the house, the tragic house, the house with nobody in it.\n\r\n I never have seen a haunted house, but I hear there are such things;\r\n That they hold the talk of spirits, their mirth and sorrowings.\r\n I know this house isn't haunted, and I wish it were, I do;\r\n For it wouldn't be so lonely if it had a ghost or two.\n\r\n This house on the road to Suffern needs a dozen panes of glass,\r\n And somebody ought to weed the walk and take a scythe to the grass.\r\n It needs new paint and shingles, and the vines should be trimmed and tied;\r\n But what it needs the most of all is some people living inside.\n\r\n If I had a lot of money and all my debts were paid\r\n I'd put a gang of men to work with brush and saw and spade.\r\n I'd buy that place and fix it up the way it used to be\r\n And I'd find some people who wanted a home and give it to them free.\n\r\n Now, a new house standing empty, with staring window and door,\r\n Looks idle, perhaps, and foolish, like a hat on its block in the store.\r\n But there's nothing mournful about it; it cannot be sad and lone\r\n For the lack of something within it that it has never known.\n\r\n But a house that has done what a house should do, a house that has sheltered life,\r\n That has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife,\r\n A house that has echoed a baby's laugh and held up his stumbling feet,\r\n Is the saddest sight, when it's left alone, that ever your eyes could meet.\n\r\n So whenever I go to Suffern along the Erie track\r\n I never go by the empty house without stopping and looking back,\r\n Yet it hurts me to look at the crumbling roof and the shutters fallen apart,\r\n For I can't help thinking the poor old house is a house with a broken heart.",

All their hands are out\r\nTo greet us, and the gentle blankets seem\r\nPurring and crooning: 'Lie in us, and dream.'\n\n\r\nII\n\r\nThe key will stammer, and the door reply,\r\n The hall wake, yawn, and smile; the torpid stair\r\nWill grumble at our feet, the table cry:\r\n 'Fetch my belongings for me; I am bare.'\r\nA clatter! Something in the attic falls.\r\n A ghost has lifted up his robes and fled.\r\nThe loitering shadows move along the walls;\r\n Then silence very slowly lifts his head.\r\nThe starling with impatient screech has flown\r\n The chimney, and is watching from the tree.\r\nThey thought us gone for ever: mouse alone\r\n Stops in the middle of the floor to see.\r\nNow all you idle things, resume your toil.\r\nHearth, put your flames on. Sulky kettle, boil.\n\n\r\nIII\n\r\nContented evening; comfortable joys;\r\n The snoozing fire, and all the fields are still:\r\nTranquil delight, no purpose, and no noise -\r\n Unless the slow wind flowing round the hill.\r\n'Murry' (the kettle) dozes; little mouse\r\n Is rambling prudently about the floor.\r\nThere's lovely conversation in this house:\r\n Words become princes that were slaves before.\r\nWhat a sweet atmosphere for you and me\r\n The people that have been here left behind....\r\nOh, but I fear it may turn out to be\r\n Built of a dream, erected in the mind:\r\nSo if we speak too loud, we may awaken\r\nTo find it vanished, and ourselves mistaken.\n\n\r\nIV\n\r\nLift up the curtain carefully. All the trees\r\n Stand in the dark like drowsy sentinels.\r\n The oak is talkative to-night; he tells\r\nThe little bushes crowding at his knees\r\nThat formidable, hard, voluminous\r\n History of growth from acorn into age.\r\nThey titter like school-children; they arouse\r\n Their comrades, who exclaim: 'He is very sage.'\r\nLook how the moon is staring through that cloud,\r\n Laying and lifting idle streaks of light.\r\nO hark! was that the monstrous wind, so loud\r\nAnd sudden, prowling always through the night?\r\nLet down the shaking curtain. They are queer,\r\nThose foreigners. They and we live so near.\n\n\r\nV\n\r\nCome, come to bed. The shadows move about,\r\n And some one seems to overhear our talk.\r\nThe fire is low; the candles flicker out;\r\n The ghosts of former tenants want to walk.\r\nAlready they are shuffling through the gloom.\r\n I felt an old man touch my shoulder-blade;\r\nOnce he was married here; they love this room,\r\n He and his woman and the child they made.\r\nDead, dead, they are, yet some familiar sound,\r\n Creeping along the brink of happy life,\r\nRevives their memory from under ground -\r\n The farmer and his troublesome old wife.\r\nLet us be going: as we climb the stairs,\r\nThey'll sit down in our warm half-empty chairs.\n\n\r\nVI\n\r\nMorning! Wake up! Awaken! All the boughs\r\n Are rippling on the air across the green.\r\nThe youngest birds are singing to the house.\r\n Blood of the world! - and is the country clean?\r\nDisturb the precinct. Cool it with a shout.\r\n Sing as you trundle down to light the fire.\r\nTurn the encumbering shadows tumbling out.\r\n And fill the chambers with a new desire.\r\nLife is no good, unless the morning brings\r\n White happiness and quick delight of day.\r\nThese half-inanimate domestic things\r\n Must all be useful, or must go away.\r\nCoffee, be fragrant. Porridge in my plate,\r\nIncrease the vigour to fulfil my fate.\n\n\r\nVII\n\r\nThe fresh air moves like water round a boat.\r\n The white clouds wander. Let us wander too.\r\nThe whining, wavering plover flap and float.\r\n That crow is flying after that cuckoo.\r\nLook! Look!... They're gone. What are the great trees calling?\r\n Just come a little farther, by that edge\r\nOf green, to where the stormy ploughland, falling\r\n Wave upon wave, is lapping to the hedge.\r\nOh, what a lovely bank! Give me your hand.\r\n Lie down and press your heart against the ground.\r\nLet us both listen till we understand,\r\n Each through the other, every natural sound....\r\nI can't hear anything to-day, can you,\r\nBut, far and near: 'Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!'?\n\n\r\nVIII\n\r\nThe everlasting grass - how bright, how cool!\r\n The day has gone too suddenly, too soon.\r\nThere's something white and shiny in that pool -\r\n Throw in a stone, and you will hit the moon.\r\nListen, the church-bell ringing! Do not say\r\n We must go back to-morrow to our work.\r\nWe'll tell them we are dead: we died to-day.\r\n We're lazy. We're too happy. We will shirk.\r\nWe're cows. We're kettles. We'll be anything\r\n Except the manikins of time and fear.\r\nWe'll start away to-morrow wandering,\r\n And nobody will notice in a year....\r\nNow the great sun is slipping under ground.\r\nGrip firmly! - How the earth is whirling round!\n\n\r\nIX\n\r\nBe staid; be careful; and be not too free.\r\nTemptation to enjoy your liberty\r\nMay rise against you, break into a crime,\r\nAnd smash the habit of employing Time.\r\nIt serves no purpose that the careful clock\r\n Mark the appointment, the officious train\r\nHurry to keep it, if the minutes mock\r\n Loud in your ear: 'Late. Late. Late. Late again.'\r\nWeek-end is very well on Saturday:\r\n On Monday it's a different affair -\r\nA little episode, a trivial stay\r\n In some oblivious spot somehow, somewhere.\r\nOn Sunday night we hardly laugh or speak:\r\nWeek-end begins to merge itself in Week.\n\n\r\nX\n\r\nPack up the house, and close the creaking door.\r\n The fields are dull this morning in the rain.\r\nIt's difficult to leave that homely floor.\r\n Wave a light hand; we will return again.\r\n(What was that bird?) Good-bye, ecstatic tree,\r\n Floating, bursting, and breathing on the air.\r\nThe lonely farm is wondering that we\r\n Can leave. How every window seems to stare!\r\nThat bag is heavy. Share it for a bit.\r\n You like that gentle swashing of the ground\r\nAs we tread?...\r\nIt is over. Now we sit\r\n Reading the morning paper in the sound\r\nOf the debilitating heavy train.\r\nLondon again, again. London again.\n",
          "\r\n It's easy to fight when everything's right,\r\n And you're mad with the thrill and the glory;\r\n It's easy to cheer when victory's near,\r\n And wallow in fields that are gory.\r\n It's a different song when everything's wrong,\r\n When you're feeling infernally mortal;\r\n When it's ten against one, and hope there is none,\r\n Buck up, little soldier, and chortle:\n\r\n Carry on! Carry on!\r\n There isn't much punch in your blow.\r\n You're glaring and staring and hitting out blind;\r\n You're muddy and bloody, but never you mind.\r\n Carry on! Carry on!\r\n You haven't the ghost of a show.\r\n It's looking like death, but while you've a breath,\r\n Carry on, my son! Carry on!\n\r\n And so in the strife of the battle of life\r\n It's easy to fight when you're winning;\r\n It's easy to slave, and starve and be brave,\r\n When the dawn of success is beginning.\r\n But the man who can meet despair and defeat\r\n With a cheer, there's the man of God's choosing;\r\n The man who can fight to Heaven's own height\r\n Is the man who can fight when he's losing.\n\r\n Carry on! Carry on!\r\n Things never were looming so black.\r\n But show that you haven't a cowardly streak,\r\n And though you're unlucky you never are weak.\r\n Carry on! Carry on!\r\n Brace up for another attack.\r\n It's looking like hell, but - you never can tell:\r\n Carry on, old man! Carry on!\n\r\n There are some who drift out in the deserts of doubt,\r\n And some who in brutishness wallow;\r\n There are others, I know, who in piety go\r\n Because of a Heaven to follow.\r\n But to labour with zest, and to give of your best,\r\n For the sweetness and joy of the giving;\r\n To help folks along with a hand and a song;\r\n Why, there's the real sunshine of living.\n\r\n Carry on! Carry on!\r\n Fight the good fight and true;\r\n Believe in your mission, greet life with a cheer;\r\n There's big work to do, and that's why you are here.\r\n Carry on! Carry on!\r\n Let the world be the better for you;\r\n And at last when you die, let this be your cry:\r\n CARRY ON, MY SOUL! CARRY ON!",
          " He hurried away, young heart of joy, under our Devon sky!\r\n And I watched him go, my beautiful boy, and a weary woman was I.\r\n For my hair is grey, and his was gold; he'd the best of his life to live;\r\n And I'd loved him so, and I'm old, I'm old; and he's all I had to give.\n\r\n Ah yes, he was proud and swift and gay, but oh how my eyes were dim!\r\n With the sun in his heart he went away, but he took the sun with him.\r\n For look! How the leaves are falling now, and the winter won't be long. . . .\r\n Oh boy, my boy with the sunny brow, and the lips of love and of song!\n\r\n How we used to sit at the day's sweet end, we two by the firelight's gleam,\r\n And we'd drift to the Valley of Let's Pretend, on the beautiful river of Dream.\r\n Oh dear little heart! All wealth untold would I gladly, gladly pay\r\n Could I just for a moment closely hold that golden head to my grey.\n\r\n For I gaze in the fire, and I'm seeing there a child, and he waves to me;\r\n And I run and I hold him up in the air, and he laughs and shouts with glee;\r\n A little bundle of love and mirth, crying: \"Come, Mumsie dear!\"\r\n Ah me! If he called from the ends of the earth I know that my heart would hear.\n\r\n. . . . .\n\r\n Yet the thought comes thrilling through all my pain: how worthier could he die?\r\n Yea, a loss like that is a glorious gain, and pitiful proud am I.\r\n For Peace must be bought with blood and tears, and the boys of our hearts must pay;\r\n And so in our joy of the after-years, let us bless them every day.\n\r\n And though I know there's a hasty grave with a poor little cross at its head,\r\n And the gold of his youth he so gladly gave, yet to me he'll never be dead.\r\n And the sun in my Devon lane will be gay, and my boy will be with me still,\r\n So I'm finding the heart to smile and say: \"Oh God, if it be Thy Will!\"",
          " The poppies gleamed like bloody pools through cotton-woolly mist;\r\n The Captain kept a-lookin' at the watch upon his wrist;\r\n And there we smoked and squatted, as we watched the shrapnel flame;\r\n 'Twas wonnerful, I'm tellin' you, how fast them bullets came.\r\n 'Twas weary work the waiting, though; I tried to sleep a wink,\r\n For waitin' means a-thinkin', and it doesn't do to think.\r\n So I closed my eyes a little, and I had a niceish dream\r\n Of a-standin' by a dresser with a dish of Devon cream;\r\n But I hadn't time to sample it, for suddenlike I woke:\r\n \"Come on, me lads!\" the Captain says, 'n I climbed out through the smoke.\n\r\n We spread out in the open: it was like a bath of lead;\r\n But the boys they cheered and hollered fit to raise the bloody dead,\r\n Till a beastly bullet copped 'em, then they lay without a sound,\r\n And it's odd - we didn't seem to heed them corpses on the ground.\r\n And I kept on thinkin', thinkin', as the bullets faster flew,\r\n How they picks the werry best men, and they lets the rotters through;\r\n So indiscriminatin' like, they spares a man of sin,\r\n And a rare lad wot's a husband and a father gets done in.\r\n And while havin' these reflections and advancin' on the run,\r\n A bullet biffs me shoulder, and says I: \"That's number one.\"\n\r\n Well, it downed me for a jiffy, but I didn't lose me calm,\r\n For I knew that I was needed: I'm a bomber, so I am.\r\n I 'ad lost me cap and rifle, but I \"carried on\" because\r\n I 'ad me bombs and knew that they was needed, so they was.\r\n We didn't 'ave no singin' now, nor many men to cheer;\r\n Maybe the shrapnel drowned 'em, crashin' out so werry near;\r\n And the Maxims got us sideways, and the bullets faster flew,\r\n And I copped one on me flipper, and says I: \"That's number two.\"\n\r\n I was pleased it was the left one, for I 'ad me bombs, ye see,\r\n And 'twas 'ard if they'd be wasted like, and all along o' me.\r\n And I'd lost me 'at and rifle - but I told you that before,\r\n So I packed me mit inside me coat and \"carried on\" once more.\r\n But the rumpus it was wicked, and the men were scarcer yet,\r\n And I felt me ginger goin', but me jaws I kindo set,\r\n And we passed the Boche first trenches, which was 'eapin' 'igh with dead,\r\n And we started for their second, which was fifty feet ahead;\r\n When something like a 'ammer smashed me savage on the knee,\r\n And down I came all muck and blood: Says I: \"That's number three.\"\n\r\n So there I lay all 'elpless like, and bloody sick at that,\r\n And worryin' like anythink, because I'd lost me 'at;\r\n And thinkin' of me missis, and the partin' words she said:\r\n \"If you gets killed, write quick, ol' man, and tell me as you're dead.\"\r\n And lookin' at me bunch o' bombs - that was the 'ardest blow,\r\n To think I'd never 'ave the chance to 'url them at the foe.\r\n And there was all our boys in front, a-fightin' there like mad,\r\n And me as could 'ave 'elped 'em wiv the lovely bombs I 'ad.\r\n And so I cussed and cussed, and then I struggled back again,\r\n Into that bit of battered trench, packed solid with its slain.\n\r\n Now as I lay a-lyin' there and blastin' of me lot,\r\n And wishin' I could just dispose of all them bombs I'd got,\r\n I sees within the doorway of a shy, retirin' dug-out\r\n Six Boches all a-grinnin', and their Captain stuck 'is mug out;\r\n And they 'ad a nice machine gun, and I twigged what they was at;\r\n And they fixed it on a tripod, and I watched 'em like a cat;\r\n And they got it in position, and they seemed so werry glad,\r\n Like they'd got us in a death-trap, which, condemn their souls! they 'ad.\r\n For there our boys was fightin' fifty yards in front, and 'ere\r\n This lousy bunch of Boches they 'ad got us in the rear.\n\r\n Oh it set me blood a-boilin' and I quite forgot me pain,\r\n So I started crawlin', crawlin' over all them mounds of slain;\r\n And them barstards was so busy-like they 'ad no eyes for me,\r\n And me bleedin' leg was draggin', but me right arm it was free. . . .\r\n And now they 'ave it all in shape, and swingin' sweet and clear;\r\n And now they're all excited like, but - I am drawin' near;\r\n And now they 'ave it loaded up, and now they're takin' aim. . . .\r\n Rat-tat-tat-tat! Oh here, says I, is where I join the game.\r\n And my right arm it goes swingin', and a bomb it goes a-slingin',\r\n And that \"typewriter\" goes wingin' in a thunderbolt of flame.\n\r\n Then these Boches, wot was left of 'em, they tumbled down their 'ole,\r\n And up I climbed a mound of dead, and down on them I stole.\r\n And oh that blessed moment when I heard their frightened yell,\r\n And I laughed down in that dug-out, ere I bombed their souls to hell.\r\n And now I'm in the hospital, surprised that I'm alive;\r\n We started out a thousand men, we came back thirty-five.\r\n And I'm minus of a trotter, but I'm most amazin' gay,\r\n For me bombs they wasn't wasted, though, you might say, \"thrown away\".",
          " Though better men may fear that trumpet's warning,\r\n I meet you, lady, on the Judgment morning,\r\n With golden hope my spirit still adorning.\n\r\n Our God who made you all so fair and sweet\r\n Is three times gentle, and before his feet\r\n Rejoicing I shall say: - \"The girl you gave\r\n Was my first Heaven, an angel bent to save.\r\n Oh, God, her maker, if my ingrate breath\r\n Is worth this rescue from the Second Death,\r\n Perhaps her dear proud eyes grow gentler too\r\n That scorned my graceless years and trophies few.\r\n Gone are those years, and gone ill-deeds that turned\r\n Her sacred beauty from my songs that burned.\r\n We now as comrades through the stars may take\r\n The rich and arduous quests I did forsake.\r\n Grant me a seraph-guide to thread the throng\r\n And quickly find that woman-soul so strong.\r\n I dream that in her deeply-hidden heart\r\n Hurt love lived on, though we were far apart,\r\n A brooding secret mercy like your own\r\n That blooms to-day to vindicate your throne.",

          "If you leave the gloom of London and you seek a glowing land,\r\nWhere all except the flag is strange and new,\r\nThere's a bronzed and stalwart fellow who will grip you by the hand,\r\nAnd greet you with a welcome warm and true;\r\nFor he's your younger brother, the one you sent away,\r\nBecause there wasn't room for him at home;\r\nAnd now he's quite contented, and he's glad he didn't stay,\r\nAnd he's building Britain's greatness o'er the foam.\n\r\nWhen the giant herd is moving at the rising of the sun,\r\nAnd the prairie is lit with rose and gold;\r\nAnd the camp is all a-bustle, and the busy day's begun,\r\nHe leaps into the saddle sure and bold.\r\nThrough the round of heat and hurry, through the racket and the rout,\r\nHe rattles at a pace that nothing mars;\r\nAnd when the night-winds whisper, and camp-fires flicker out,\r\nHe is sleeping like a child beneath the stars.\n\r\nWhen the wattle-blooms are drooping in the sombre she-oak glade,\r\nAnd the breathless land is lying in a swoon,\r\nHe leaves his work a moment, leaning lightly on his spade,\r\nAnd he hears the bell-bird chime the Austral noon.\r\nThe parakeets are silent in the gum-tree by the creek;\r\nThe ferny grove is sunshine-steeped and still;\r\nBut the dew will gem the myrtle in the twilight ere he seek\r\nHis little lonely cabin on the hill.\n\r\nAround the purple, vine-clad slope the argent river dreams;\r\nThe roses almost hide the house from view;\r\nA snow-peak of the Winterberg in crimson splendour gleams;\r\nThe shadow deepens down on the karroo.\r\nHe seeks the lily-scented dusk beneath the orange-tree:\r\nHis pipe in silence glows and fades and glows,\r\nAnd then two little maids come out and climb upon his knee,\r\nAnd one is like the lily, one the rose.\r\nHe sees his white sheep dapple o'er the green New Zealand plain,\r\nAnd where Vancouver's shaggy ramparts frown,\r\nWhen the sunlight threads the pine-gloom he is fighting might and main\r\nTo clinch the rivets of an Empire down.\r\nYou will find him toiling, toiling, in the south or in the west,\r\nA child of nature, fearless, frank and free;\r\nAnd the warmest heart that beats for you is beating in his breast,\r\nAnd he sends you loyal greeting o'er the sea.\n\r\nYou've a brother in the Army, you've another in the Church;\r\nOne of you is a diplomatic swell;\r\nYou've had the pick of everything and left him in the lurch;\r\nAnd yet I think he's doing very well.\r\nI'm sure his life is happy, and he doesn't envy yours;\r\nI know he loves the land his pluck has won;\r\nAnd I fancy in the years unborn, while England's fame endures,\r\nShe will come to bless with pride - the Younger Son.",
          "These pools that, though in forests, still reflect\r\nThe total sky almost without defect,\r\nAnd like the flowers beside them, chill and shiver,\r\nWill like the flowers beside them soon be gone,\r\nAnd yet not out by any brook or river,\r\nBut up by roots to bring dark foliage on.\r\nThe trees that have it in their pent-up buds\r\nTo darken nature and be summer woods\r\nLet them think twice before they use their powers\r\nTo blot out and drink up and sweep away\r\nThese flowery waters and these watery flowers\r\nFrom snow that melted only yesterday.\n",
          "The pale road winds faintly upward into the dark skies,\r\nAnd beside it on the rough grass that the wind invisibly stirs,\r\nSheltered by sharp-speared gorse and the berried junipers,\r\nShining steadily with a green light, the glow-worm lies.\n\r\nWe regard it; and this hill and all the other hills\r\nThat fall in folds to the river, very smooth and steep,\r\nAnd the hangers and brakes that the darkness thickly fills\r\nFade like phantoms round the light, and night is deep, so deep, -\n\r\nThat all the world is emptiness about the still flame,\r\nAnd we are small shadows standing lost in the huge night.\r\nWe gather up the glow-worm, stooping with dazzled sight,\r\nAnd carry it to the little enclosed garden whence we came,\n\r\nAnd place it on the short grass. Then the shadowy flowers fade,\r\nThe walls waver and melt and the houses disappear\r\nAnd the solid town trembles into insubstantial shade\r\nRound the light of the burning glow-worm, steady and clear.\n",
          "The room is full of the peace of night,\r\nThe small flames murmur and flicker and sway,\r\nWithin me is neither shadow, nor light,\r\nNor night, nor twilight, nor dawn, nor day.\n\r\nFor the brain strives not to the goal of thought,\r\nAnd the limbs lie wearied, and all desire\r\nSleeps for a while, and I am naught\r\nBut a pair of eyes that gaze at a fire.\n",
          "I have sought and followed you, drunk with your sacred wine;\r\nLed out by a laughing wind on a tumbling sea,\r\nOn crags amid clouds, in cups that allure the bee,\r\nAnd deep in the gem-lit gloom of the tortuous mine,\r\nAnd on widespread wings where the great worlds dance and shine\r\nI have sought by the golden light; but have bent the knee\r\nAt last where you lie, a humble goddess and free,\r\nNaked and flushed in the warmth of a crimson shrine.\r\nThe hordes of hate have trampled your blooms in mire,\r\nAnd cackle and roar as their mockery priests blaspheme,\r\nAnd sing the marching hymn of a wingless might.\r\nThey forge their god in the heat of unholy fire\r\nThe squat strong incubus born of an evil dream;\r\nAnd it shrinks and crumbles away in the golden light.",

If all goes well,\r\nThen, at the least, my friend, you'll see a moon\r\nStranger, but nearer, many a thousand mile\r\nThan earth has ever seen her, even in dreams.\r\nAs for the stars, if seeing them were all,\r\nThree thousand million new-found points of light\r\nIs our rough guess. But never speak of this.\r\nYou know our press. They'd miss the one result\r\nTo flash 'three thousand millions' round the world.\"\r\nTo-morrow night! For more than twenty years,\r\nThey had thought and planned and worked. Ten years had gone,\r\nOne-fourth, or more, of man's brief working life,\r\nBefore they made those solid tons of glass,\r\nTheir hundred-inch reflector, the clear pool,\r\nThe polished flawless pool that it must be\r\nTo hold the perfect image of a star.\r\nAnd, even now, some secret flaw--none knew\r\nUntil to-morrow's test--might waste it all.\r\nWhere was the gambler that would stake so much,--\r\nTime, patience, treasure, on a single throw?\r\nThe cost of it,--they'd not find that again,\r\nEither in gold or life-stuff! All their youth\r\nWas fuel to the flame of this one work.\r\nOnce in a lifetime to the man of science,\r\nDespite what fools believe his ice-cooled blood,\r\nThere comes this drama.\r\nIf he fails, he fails\r\nUtterly. He at least will have no time\r\nFor fresh beginnings. Other men, no doubt,\r\nYears hence, will use the footholes that he cut\r\nIn those precipitous cliffs, and reach the height,\r\nBut he will never see it.\"\r\nSo for me,\r\nThe light words of that letter seemed to hide\r\nThe passion of a lifetime, and I shared\r\nThe crowning moment of its hope and fear.\r\nNext day, through whispering aisles of palm we rode\r\nUp to the foot-hills, dreaming desert-hills\r\nThat to assuage their own delicious drought\r\nHad set each tawny sun-kissed slope ablaze\r\nWith peach and orange orchards.\r\nUp and up,\r\nAlong the thin white trail that wound and climbed\r\nAnd zig-zagged through the grey-green mountain sage,\r\nThe car went crawling, till the shining plain\r\nBelow it, like an airman's map, unrolled.\r\nHouses and orchards dwindled to white specks\r\nIn midget cubes and squares of tufted green.\r\nOnce, as we rounded one steep curve, that made\r\nThe head swim at the canyoned gulf below,\r\nWe saw through thirty miles of lucid air\r\nElvishly small, sharp as a crumpled petal\r\nBlown from the stem, a yard away, a sail\r\nLazily drifting on the warm blue sea.\r\nUp for nine miles along that spiral trail\r\nSlowly we wound to reach the lucid height\r\nAbove the clouds, where that white dome of shell,\r\nNo wren's now, but an eagle's, took the flush\r\nOf dying day. The sage-brush all died out,\r\nAnd all the southern growths, and round us now,\r\nFirs of the north, and strong, storm-rooted pines\r\nExhaled a keener fragrance; till, at last,\r\nReversing all the laws of lesser hills,\r\nThey towered like giants round us. Darkness fell\r\nBefore we reached the mountain's naked height.\n\r\nOver us, like some great cathedral dome,\r\nThe observatory loomed against the sky;\r\nAnd the dark mountain with its headlong gulfs\r\nHad lost all memory of the world below;\r\nFor all those cloudless throngs of glittering stars\r\nAnd all those glimmerings where the abyss of space\r\nIs powdered with a milky dust, each grain\r\nA burning sun, and every sun the lord\r\nOf its own darkling planets,--all those lights\r\nMet, in a darker deep, the lights of earth,\r\nLights on the sea, lights of invisible towns,\r\nTrembling and indistinguishable from stars,\r\nIn those black gulfs around the mountain's feet.\r\nThen, into the glimmering dome, with bated breath,\r\nWe entered, and, above us, in the gloom\r\nSaw that majestic weapon of the light\r\nUptowering like the shaft of some huge gun\r\nThrough one arched rift of sky.\r\nDark at its base\r\nWith naked arms, the crew that all day long\r\nHad sweated to make ready for this night\r\nWaited their captain's word.\r\n The switchboard shone\r\nWith elfin lamps of white and red, and keys\r\nWhence, at a finger's touch, that monstrous tube\r\nMoved like a creature dowered with life and will,\r\nTo peer from deep to deep.\r\n Below it pulsed\r\nThe clock-machine that slowly, throb by throb,\r\nTimed to the pace of the revolving earth,\r\nDrove the titanic muzzle on and on,\r\nFixed to the chosen star that else would glide\r\nOut of its field of vision.\r\nSo, set free\r\nBalanced against the wheel of time, it swung,\r\nOr rested, while, to find new realms of sky\r\nThe dome that housed it, like a moon revolved,\r\nSo smoothly that the watchers hardly knew\r\nThey moved within; till, through the glimmering doors,\r\nThey saw the dark procession of the pines\r\nLike Indian warriors, quietly stealing by.\n\r\nThen, at a word, the mighty weapon dipped\r\nIts muzzle and aimed at one small point of light\r\nOne seeming insignificant star.\r\nThe chief,\r\nMounting the ladder, while we held our breath,\r\nLooked through the eye-piece.\r\nThen we heard him laugh\r\nHis thanks to God, and hide it in a jest.\r\n\"A prominence on Jupiter!\"--\r\n They laughed,\r\n\"What do you mean?\"--\"It's moving,\" cried the chief,\r\nThey laughed again, and watched his glimmering face\r\nHigh overhead against that moving tower.\r\n\"Come up and see, then!\"\r\n One by one they went,\r\nAnd, though each laughed as he returned to earth,\r\nTheir souls were in their eyes.\r\nThen I, too, looked,\r\nAnd saw that insignificant spark of light\r\nTouched with new meaning, beautifully reborn,\r\nA swimming world, a perfect rounded pearl,\r\nPoised in the violet sky; and, as I gazed,\r\nI saw a miracle,--right on its upmost edge\r\nA tiny mound of white that slowly rose,\r\nThen, like an exquisite seed-pearl, swung quite clear\r\nAnd swam in heaven above its parent world\r\nTo greet its three bright sister-moons.\r\nA moon,\r\nOf Jupiter, no more, but clearer far\r\nThan mortal eyes had seen before from earth,\r\nO, beautiful and clear beyond all dreams\r\nWas that one silver phrase of the starry tune\r\nWhich Galileo's \"old discoverer\" first\r\nDimly revealed, dissolving into clouds\r\nThe imagined fabric of our universe.\r\n\"Jupiter stands in heaven and will stand\r\nThough all the sycophants bark at him,\" he cried,\r\nHailing the truth before he, too, went down,\r\nWhelmed in the cloudy wreckage of that dream.\n\r\nSo one by one we looked, the men who served\r\nUrania, and the men from Vulcan's forge.\r\nA beautiful eagerness in the darkness lit\r\nThe swarthy faces that too long had missed\r\nA meaning in the dull mechanic maze\r\nOf labour on this blind earth, but found it now.\r\nThough only a moment's wandering melody\r\nHopelessly far above, it gave their toil\r\nIts only consecration and its joy.\r\nThere, with dark-smouldering eyes and naked throats,\r\nBlue-dungareed, red-shirted, grimed and smeared\r\nWith engine-grease and sweat, they gathered round\r\nThe foot of that dim ladder; each muttering low\r\nAs he came down, his wonder at what he saw\r\nTo those who waited,--a picture for the brush\r\nOf Rembrandt, lighted only by the rift\r\nAbove them, where the giant muzzle thrust\r\nOut through the dim arched roof, and slowly throbbed,\r\nAgainst the slowly moving wheel of the earth,\r\nHolding their chosen star.\r\n There, like an elf,\r\nPerched on the side of that dark slanting tower\r\nThe Italian mechanician watched the moons,\r\nThat Italy discovered.\r\n One by one,\r\nAmerican, English, French, and Dutch, they climbed\r\nTo see the wonder that their own blind hands\r\nHad helped to achieve.\r\n At midnight while they paused\r\nTo adjust the clock-machine, I wandered out\r\nAlone, into the silence of the night.\r\nThe silence? On that lonely height I heard\r\nEternal voices;\r\nFor, as I looked into the gulf beneath,\r\nWhence almost all the lights had vanished now,\r\nThe whole dark mountain seemed to have lost its earth\r\nAnd to be sailing like a ship through heaven.\r\nAll round it surged the mighty sea-like sound\r\nOf soughing pine-woods, one vast ebb and flow\r\nOf absolute peace, aloof from all earth's pain,\r\nSo calm, so quiet, it seemed the cradle-song,\r\nThe deep soft breathing of the universe\r\nOver its youngest child, the soul of man.\r\nAnd, as I listened, that Aeolian voice\r\nBecame an invocation and a prayer:\r\nO you, that on your loftier mountain dwell\r\nAnd move like light in light among the thoughts\r\nOf heaven, translating our mortality\r\nInto immortal song, is there not one\r\nAmong you that can turn to music now\r\nThis long dark fight for truth? Not one to touch\r\nWith beauty this long battle for the light,\r\nThis little victory of the spirit of man\r\nDoomed to defeat--for what was all we saw\r\nTo that which neither eyes nor soul could see?--\r\nDoomed to defeat and yet unconquerable,\r\nClimbing its nine miles nearer to the stars.\r\nWars we have sung. The blind, blood-boltered kings\r\nMove with an epic music to their thrones.\r\nHave you no song, then, of that nobler war?\r\nOf those who strove for light, but could not dream\r\nEven of this victory that they helped to win,\r\nSilent discoverers, lonely pioneers,\r\nPrisoners and exiles, martyrs of the truth\r\nWho handed on the fire, from age to age;\r\nOf those who, step by step, drove back the night\r\nAnd struggled, year on year, for one more glimpse\r\nAmong the stars, of sovran law, their guide;\r\nOf those who searching inward, saw the rocks\r\nDissolving into a new abyss, and saw\r\nThose planetary systems far within,\r\nAtoms, electrons, whirling on their way\r\nTo build and to unbuild our solid world;\r\nOf those who conquered, inch by difficult inch,\r\nThe freedom of this realm of law for man;\r\nDreamers of dreams, the builders of our hope,\r\nThe healers and the binders up of wounds,\r\nWho, while the dynasts drenched the world with blood,\r\nWould in the still small circle of a lamp\r\nWrestle with death like Heracles of old\r\nTo save one stricken child.\r\nIs there no song\r\nTo touch this moving universe of law\r\nWith ultimate light, the glimmer of that great dawn\r\nWhich over our ruined altars yet shall break\r\nIn purer splendour, and restore mankind\r\nFrom darker dreams than even Lucretius knew\r\nTo vision of that one Power which guides the world.\r\nHow should men find it? Only through those doors\r\nWhich, opening inward, in each separate soul\r\nGive each man access to that Soul of all\r\nLiving within each life, not to be found\r\nOr known, till, looking inward, each alone\r\nMeets the unknowable and eternal God.\n\r\nAnd there was one that moved like light in light\r\nBefore me there,--Love, human and divine,\r\nThat can exalt all weakness into power,--\r\nWhispering, Take this deathless torch of song...\r\nWhispering, but with such faith, that even I\r\nWas humbled into thinking this might be\r\nThrough love, though all the wisdom of the world\r\nAccount it folly.\r\nLet my breast be bared\r\nTo every shaft, then, so that Love be still\r\nMy one celestial guide the while I sing\r\nOf those who caught the pure Promethean fire\r\nOne from another, each crying as he went down\r\nTo one that waited, crowned with youth and joy,--\r\nTake thou the splendour, carry it out of sight\r\nInto the great new age I must not know,\r\nInto the great new realm I must not tread.",

          "(To those who live there)\n\r\nFor peace, than knowledge more desirable,\r\n Into your Sussex quietness I came,\r\nWhen summer's green and gold and azure fell\r\n Over the world in flame.\n\r\nAnd peace upon your pasture-lands I found,\r\n Where grazing flocks drift on continually,\r\nAs little clouds that travel with no sound\r\n Across a windless sky.\n\r\nOut of your oaks the birds call to their mates\r\n That brood among the pines, where hidden deep\r\nFrom curious eyes a world's adventure waits\r\n In columned choirs of sleep.\n\r\nUnder the calm ascension of the night\r\n We heard the mellow lapsing and return\r\nOf night-owls purring in their groundling flight\r\n Through lanes of darkling fern.\n\r\nUnbroken peace when all the stars were drawn\r\n Back to their lairs of light, and ranked along\r\nFrom shire to shire the downs out of the dawn\r\n Were risen in golden song.\n\r\n*****\n\r\nI sing of peace who have known the large unrest\r\n Of men bewildered in their travelling,\r\nAnd I have known the bridal earth unblest\r\n By the brigades of spring.\n\r\nI have known that loss. And now the broken thought\r\nOf nations marketing in death I know,\r\nThe very winds to threnodies are wrought\r\nThat on your downlands blow.\n\r\nI sing of peace. Was it but yesterday\r\nI came among your roses and your corn?\r\nThen momently amid this wrath I pray\r\nFor yesterday reborn.",

As I lie\r\nAbed between cool walls I watch the host\r\n Of the slow stars lit over Gloucester plain,\r\nAnd drowsily the habit of these most\r\n Beloved of English lands moves in my brain,\r\nWhile silence holds dominion of the dark,\r\nSave when the foxes from the spinneys bark.\n\r\nI see the valleys in their morning mist\r\n Wreathed under limpid hills in moving light,\r\nHappy with many a yeoman melodist:\r\n I see the little roads of twinkling white\r\nBusy with fieldward teams and market gear\r\n Of rosy men, cloth-gaitered, who can tell\r\nThe many-minded changes of the year,\r\n Who know why crops and kine fare ill or well;\r\nI see the sun persuade the mist away,\r\nTill town and stead are shining to the day.\n\r\nI see the wagons move along the rows\r\n Of ripe and summer-breathing clover-flower,\r\nI see the lissom husbandman who knows\r\n Deep in his heart the beauty of his power,\r\nAs, lithely pitched, the full-heaped fork bids on\r\n The harvest home. I hear the rickyard fill\r\nWith gossip as in generations gone,\r\n While wagon follows wagon from the hill.\r\nI think how, when our seasons all are sealed,\r\nShall come the unchanging harvest from the field.\n\r\nI see the barns and comely manors planned\r\n By men who somehow moved in comely thought,\r\nWho, with a simple shippon to their hand,\r\n As men upon some godlike business wrought;\r\nI see the little cottages that keep\r\n Their beauty still where since Plantagenet\r\nHave come the shepherds happily to sleep,\r\n Finding the loaves and cups of cider set;\r\nI see the twisted shepherds, brown and old,\r\nDriving at dusk their glimmering sheep to fold.\n\r\nAnd now the valleys that upon the sun\r\n Broke from their opal veils, are veiled again,\r\nAnd the last light upon the wolds is done,\r\n And silence falls on flock and fields and men;\r\nAnd black upon the night I watch my hill,\r\n And the stars shine, and there an owly wing\r\nBrushes the night, and all again is still,\r\n And, from this land of worship that I sing,\r\nI turn to sleep, content that from my sires\r\nI draw the blood of England's midmost shires.\n",

my spirit swings,\r\nIn triumph shouts \"Aha, you swine!\r\nGrovel before your lord divine!\r\nI, only I, am real here! ...\"\r\nThrough the uncertain firmament,\r\nStill bestial in their dull content.\r\nThe despicable phantoms leer...\r\nHogs! even now in my right hand\r\nI hold at my will the thunderbolts\r\nMeasured not in mortal volts,\r\nWould crash you to annihilation!\r\nLit with a new illumination,\r\nWhat need I of ears and eyes\r\nOf flesh?Imperious I will rise,\r\nDominate you as a god\r\nWho only does not trouble to wield the rod\r\nOf death, or kick your weak spheroid\r\nLike a football through the void!\n\r\n * * * * *\n\r\nHa! was it but a dream?\r\nAnd did it merely seem?\r\nHa! not yet free of your cage,\r\nSoul, spite of all your rage?\r\nCome now,

shock\r\nA soft, tremendous shock\r\nOf contact with the body; I lose all power,\r\nAnd fall back, back, like a solitary rower\r\nWhose prow that debonair the waves did ride\r\nIs suddenly hurled back by an iron tide.\r\nO sadness, sadness, feel the returning pain\r\nOf touch with unescapable mortal things again!\r\nThe cloth is linen, the floor is wood,\r\nMy plate holds cheese, my tumbler

now\r\n(Not for the first time), even now\r\nClear in your ears has rung the message\r\nThat tense abstraction is the passage\r\nTo nervelessness and living death.\r\nNever forget while you draw breath\r\nThat all the hammers of will can never\r\nYour chain'd soul from matter sever;\r\nAnd though it be confused and mixed,\r\nThis is the world in which you're fixed.\r\nNever despise the things that are.\r\nSet your teeth upon the grit.\r\nThough your heart like a motor beat,\r\nHold fast this earthly star,\r\nThe whole of it, the whole of it.\n\r\nLook on this crowd now, calm now, look.\r\nRemember now that each one drew\r\nWoman's milk (which you partook)\r\nAnd year by year in wonder grew.\r\nScorn not them, nor scorn not their feasts\r\n(Which you partake) nor call them beasts.\r\nThese be children of one Power\r\nWith you, nor higher you nor lower.\r\nThey also hear the harp and fiddle,\r\nAnd sometimes quail before the riddle.\r\nThey also have hot blood, quick thought,\r\nAnd try to do the things they ought,\r\nThey also have hearts that ache when stung.\r\nAnd sigh for days when they were young,\r\nAnd curse their wills because they falter,\r\nAnd know that they will never alter.\r\nSee these men in a world of men.\r\nMaterial bodies?, yes, what then?\r\nThese coarse trunks that here you see\r\nJudge them not, lest judged you be,\r\nBow not to the moment's curse,\r\nNor make four walls a universe.\r\nThink of these bodies here assembled,\r\nWhence they have come, where they have trembled\r\nWith the strange force that fills us all.\r\nMen and beasts both great and small.\r\nHere within this fleeting home\r\nTwo hundred men have this day come;\r\nHere collected for one day,\r\nEach shall go his separate way.\r\nSelf, you can imagine nought\r\nOf all the battles they have fought,\r\nAll the labours they have done,\r\nAll the journeys they have run.\r\nO, they have come from all the world,\r\nBorne by invisible currents, swirled\r\nLike leaves into this vortex here\r\nFlying, or like the spirits drear\r\nWindborne and frail, whom Dante saw,\r\nWho yet obeyed some hidden law.\n\r\n * * * * *\n\r\nIs it not miraculous\r\nThat they should here be gathered thus,\r\nAll to be spread before your view,\r\nWho are strange to them as they to you?\r\nSoul, how can you sustain without a sob,\r\nThe lightest thought of this titanic throb\r\nOf earthly life, that swells and breaks\r\nInto leaping scattering waves of fire,\r\nInto tameless tempests of effort and storms of desire\r\nThat eternally makes\r\nThe confused glittering armies of humankind,\r\nTo their own heroism blind,\r\nSwarm over the earth to build, to dig, and to till,\r\nTo mould and compel land and sea to their will...\r\nWhence we are here eating...\r\nStanding here as on a high hill,\r\nStrain, my imagination, strain forth to embrace\r\nThe energies that labour for this place,\r\nThis place, this instant.Beyond your island's verge,\r\nListen, and hear the roaring impulsive surge,\r\nThe clamour of voices, the blasting of powder, the clanging of steel,\r\nThe thunder of hammers, the rattle of oars...\r\nFor this one meal\r\nTen thousand Indian hamlets stored their yields,\r\nManchurian peasants sweltered in their fields,\r\nAnd Greeks drove carts to Patras, and lone men\r\nSaw burning summer come and go again\r\nAnd huddled from the winds of winter on\r\nThe fertile deserts of Saskatchewan.\r\nTo fabricate these things have been marchings and slaughters,\r\nThe sun has toiled and the moon has moved the waters,\r\nCities have laboured, and crowded plains, and deep in the earth\r\nMen have plunged unafraid with ardour to wrench the worth\r\nOf sweating dim-lit caverns, and paths have been hewn\r\nThrough forests where for uncounted years nor sun nor moon\r\nHave penetrated, men have driven straight shining rails\r\nThrough the dense bowels of mountains, and climbed their frozen tops, and wrinkled sailors have shouted at shouting gales\r\nIn the huge Pacific, and battled around the Horn\r\nAnd gasping, coasted to Rio, and turning towards the morn,\r\nFought over the wastes to Spain, and battered and worn,\r\nSailed up the Channel, and on into the Nore\r\nTo the city of masts and the smoky familiar shore.\n\r\nSo, so of every substance you see around\r\nMight a tale be unwound\r\nOf perils passed, of adventurous journeys made\r\nIn man's undying and stupendous crusade.\r\nThis flower of man's energies Trade\r\nBrought hither to hand and lip\r\nBy waggon, train or ship,\r\nEach atom that we eat....\r\nStare at the wine, stare at the meat.\r\nThe mutton which these platters fills\r\nGrazed upon a thousand hills;\r\nThis bread so square and white and dry\r\nOnce was corn that sang to the sky;\r\nAnd all these spruce, obedient wines\r\nFlowed from the vatted fruit of vines\r\nThat trailed, a bright maternal host,\r\nThe warm Mediterranean coast,\r\nOr spread their Bacchic mantle on\r\nThat Iberian Helicon\r\nWhere the slopes of Portugal\r\nCrown the Atlantic's eastern wall.\n\r\nO mighty energy, never-failing flame!\r\nO patient toils and journeys in the name\r\nOf Trade!No journey ever was the same\r\nAs another, nor ever came again one task;\r\nAnd each man's face is an ever-changing mask.\r\nFrom the minutest cell to the lordliest star\r\nAll things are unique, though all of their kindred are.\r\nAnd though all things exist for ever, all life is change,\r\nAnd the oldest passions come to each heart in a garment strange.\r\nThough life be as brief as a flower and the body but dust,\r\nMan walks the earth holding both body and spirit in trust;\r\nAnd the various glories of sense are spread for his delight,\r\nNew pageants glow in the sunset, new stars are born in the night,\r\nAnd clouds come every day, and never a shape recurs,\r\nAnd the grass grows every year, yet never the same blade stirs\r\nAnother spring, and no delving man breaks again the self-same clod\r\nAs he did last year though he stand once more where last year he trod.\r\nO wonderful procession fore-ordained by God!\r\nWonderful in unity, wonderful in diversity.\r\nContemplate it, soul, and see\r\nHow the material universe moves and strives with anguish and glee!\n\r\n * * * * *\n\r\nI was born for that reason,\r\nWith muscles, heart and eyes,\r\nTo watch each following season,\r\nTo work and to be wise;\r\nNot body and mind to tether\r\nTo unseen things alone,\r\nBut to traverse together\r\nThe known and the unknown.\r\nMy muscles were not welded\r\nTo waste away in sleep,\r\nMy bones were never builded\r\nTo throw upon a heap.\r\n\"Man worships God in action,\"\r\nSenses and reason call,\r\n\"And thought is putrefaction,\r\nIf thought is all in all!\"\n\r\nMost of the guests are gone; look over there,\r\nAgainst a pillar leans with absent air\r\nA tall, dark, pallid waiter.There he stands\r\nLimply, with vacant eyes and listless hands.\r\nHe dreams of some small Tyrolean town,\r\nA church, a bridge, a stream that rushes down.\r\nA frustrate, hankering man, this one short time\r\nUnconscious he into my gaze did climb;\r\nHe sinks again, again he is but one\r\nOf many myriads underneath the sun,\r\nNow faint, now vivid....How puzzling is it all!\r\nFor now again, in spite of all,\r\nThe lights, the chairs, the diners, and the hall\r\nLose their opacity.\r\nFool! exert your will,\r\nFinish your whisky up, and pay your bill.\n",

          "A gaunt and relentless wolf, possessed\r\nOf a quite insatiable thirst,\r\nOnce paused at a stream to drink and rest,\r\nAnd found that, bound on a similar quest,\r\nA lamb had arrived there first.\n\r\nThe lamb was a lamb of a garrulous mind\r\nAnd frivolity most extreme:\r\nIn the fashion common to all his kind,\r\nHe cantered in front and galloped behind.\r\nAnd troubled the limpid stream.\n\r\n\"My friend,\" said the wolf, with a winsome air,\r\n\"Your capers I can't admire.\"\r\n\"Go to!\" quoth the lamb. (Though he said not where,\r\nHe showed what he meant by his brazen stare\r\nAnd the way that he gambolled higher.)\n\r\n\"My capers,\" he cried, \"are the kind that are\r\nInvariably served with lamb.\r\nRemember, this is a public bar,\r\nAnd I'll do as I please. If your drink I mar,\r\nI don't give a tinker's ----.\"\n\r\nHe paused and glanced at the rivulet,\r\nAnd that pause than speech was worse,\r\nFor his roving eye a saw-mill met,\r\nAnd, near it, the word which should be set\r\nAt the end of the previous verse.\n\r\nSaid the wolf: \"You are tough and may bring remorse,\r\nBut of such is the world well rid.\r\nI've swallowed your capers, I've swallowed your sauce,\r\nAnd it's plain to be seen that my only course\r\nIs swallowing you.\" He did.\n\r\nTHE MORAL: The wisest lambs they are\r\nWho, when they're assailed by thirst,\r\nKeep well away from a public bar;\r\nFor of all black sheep, or near, or far,\r\nThe public bar-lamb's worst!",

B. Yeats.\n\n\n\r\nPatting goodbye, doubtless they told the lad\r\nHe'd always show the Hun a brave man's face;\r\nFather would sooner him dead than in disgrace,--\r\nWas proud to see him going, aye, and glad.\r\nPerhaps his Mother whimpered how she'd fret\r\nUntil he got a nice, safe wound to nurse.\r\nSisters would wish girls too could shoot, charge, curse, . . .\r\nBrothers--would send his favourite cigarette,\r\nEach week, month after month, they wrote the same,\r\nThinking him sheltered in some Y.M. Hut,\r\nWhere once an hour a bullet missed its aim\r\nAnd misses teased the hunger of his brain.\r\nHis eyes grew old with wincing, and his hand\r\nReckless with ague. Courage leaked, as sand\r\nFrom the best sandbags after years of rain.\r\nBut never leave, wound, fever, trench-foot, shock,\r\nUntrapped the wretch. And death seemed still withheld\r\nFor torture of lying machinally shelled,\r\nAt the pleasure of this world's Powers who'd run amok.\n\r\nHe'd seen men shoot their hands, on night patrol,\r\nTheir people never knew. Yet they were vile.\r\n\"Death sooner than dishonour, that's the style!\"\r\nSo Father said.\n\r\nOne dawn, our wire patrol\r\nCarried him. This time, Death had not missed.\r\nWe could do nothing, but wipe his bleeding cough.\r\nCould it be accident?--Rifles go off . . .\r\nNot sniped? No. (Later they found the English ball.)\n\r\nIt was the reasoned crisis of his soul.\r\nAgainst the fires that would not burn him whole\r\nBut kept him for death's perjury and scoff\r\nAnd life's half-promising, and both their riling.\n\r\nWith him they buried the muzzle his teeth had kissed,\r\nAnd truthfully wrote the Mother \"Tim died smiling.\"\n",

          "I\n\n\r\nThey thought him a magician, Tycho Brahe,\r\nWho lived on that strange island in the Sound,\r\nNine miles from Elsinore.\r\nHis legend reached\r\nThe Mermaid Inn the year that Shakespeare died.\r\nFynes Moryson had brought his travellers' tales\r\nOf Wheen, the heart-shaped isle where Tycho made\r\nHis great discoveries, and, with Jeppe, his dwarf,\r\nAnd flaxen-haired Christine, the peasant girl,\r\nDreamed his great dreams for five-and-twenty years.\r\nFor there he lit that lanthorn of the law,\r\nUraniborg; that fortress of the truth,\r\nWith Pegasus flying above its loftiest tower,\r\nWhile, in its roofs, like wide enchanted eyes\r\nWatching, the brightest windows in the world,\r\nOpened upon the stars.\n\r\nNine miles from Elsinore, with all those ghosts,\r\nThere's magic enough in that! But white-cliffed Wheen,\r\nSix miles in girth, with crowds of hunchback waves\r\nCrawling all round it, and those moonstruck windows,\r\nHeld its own magic, too; for Tycho Brahe\r\nBy his mysterious alchemy of dreams\r\nHad so enriched the soil, that when the king\r\nOf England wished to buy it, Denmark asked\r\nA price too great for any king on earth.\r\n\"Give us,\" they said, \"in scarlet cardinal's cloth\r\nEnough to cover it, and, at every corner,\r\nOf every piece, a right rose-noble too;\r\nThen all that kings can buy of Wheen is yours.\r\nOnly,\" said they, \"a merchant bought it once;\r\nAnd, when he came to claim it, goblins flocked\r\nAll round him, from its forty goblin farms,\r\nAnd mocked him, bidding him take away the stones\r\nThat he had bought, for nothing else was his.\"\r\nThese things were fables. They were also true.\r\nThey thought him a magician, Tycho Brahe,\r\nThe astrologer, who wore the mask of gold.\r\nPerhaps he was. There's magic in the truth;\r\nAnd only those who find and follow its laws\r\nCan work its miracles.\r\n Tycho sought the truth\r\nFrom that strange year in boyhood when he heard\r\nThe great eclipse foretold; and, on the day\r\nAppointed, at the very minute even,\r\nBeheld the weirdly punctual shadow creep\r\nAcross the sun, bewildering all the birds\r\nWith thoughts of evening.\r\nPicture him, on that day,\r\nThe boy at Copenhagen, with his mane\r\nOf thick red hair, thrusting his freckled face\r\nOut of his upper window, holding the piece\r\nOf glass he blackened above his candle-flame\r\nTo watch that orange ember in the sky\r\nWane into smouldering ash.\r\n He whispered there,\r\n\"So it is true. By searching in the heavens,\r\nMen can foretell the future.\"\r\nIn the street\r\nBelow him, throngs were babbling of the plague\r\nThat might or might not follow.\r\nHe resolved\r\nTo make himself the master of that deep art\r\nAnd know what might be known.\r\nHe bought the books\r\nOf Stadius, with his tables of the stars.\r\nNight after night, among the gabled roofs,\r\nClimbing and creeping through a world unknown\r\nSave to the roosting stork, he learned to find\r\nThe constellations, Cassiopeia's throne,\r\nThe Plough still pointing to the Polar Star,\r\nThe sword-belt of Orion. There he watched\r\nThe movements of the planets, hours on hours,\r\nAnd wondered at the mystery of it all.\r\nAll this he did in secret, for his birth\r\nWas noble, and such wonderings were a sign\r\nOf low estate, when Tycho Brahe was young;\r\nAnd all his kinsmen hoped that Tycho Brahe\r\nWould live, serene as they, among his dogs\r\nAnd horses; or, if honour must be won,\r\nLet the superfluous glory flow from fields\r\nWhere blood might still be shed; or from those courts\r\nWhere statesmen lie. But Tycho sought the truth.\r\nSo, when they sent him in his tutor's charge\r\nTo Leipzig, for such studies as they held\r\nMore worthy of his princely blood, he searched\r\nThe Almagest; and, while his tutor slept,\r\nMeasured the delicate angles of the stars,\r\nOut of his window, with his compasses,\r\nHis only instrument. Even with this rude aid\r\nHe found so many an ancient record wrong\r\nThat more and more he burned to find the truth.\n\r\nOne night at home, as Tycho searched the sky,\r\nOut of his window, compasses in hand,\r\nFixing one point upon a planet, one\r\nUpon some loftier star, a ripple of laughter\r\nStartled him, from the garden walk below.\r\nHe lowered his compass, peered into the dark\r\nAnd saw--Christine, the blue-eyed peasant girl,\r\nWith bare brown feet, standing among the flowers.\r\nShe held what seemed an apple in her hand;\r\nAnd, in a voice that Aprilled all his blood,\r\nThe low soft voice of earth, drawing him down\r\nFrom those cold heights to that warm breast of Spring,\r\nA natural voice that had not learned to use\r\nThe false tones of the world, simple and clear\r\nAs a bird's voice, out of the fragrant darkness called,\r\n\"I saw it falling from your window-ledge!\r\nI thought it was an apple, till it rolled\r\nOver my foot.\r\nIt's heavy. Shall I try\r\nTo throw it back to you?\"\r\nTycho saw a stain\r\nOf purple across one small arched glistening foot.\r\n\"Your foot Is bruised,\" he cried.\r\n\"O no,\" she laughed,\r\nAnd plucked the stain off. \"Only a petal, see.\"\r\nShe showed it to him.\r\n\"But this--I wonder now\r\nIf I can throw it.\"\r\nTwice she tried and failed;\r\nOr Tycho failed to catch that slippery sphere.\r\nHe saw the supple body swaying below,\r\nThe ripe red lips that parted as she laughed,\r\nAnd those deep eyes where all the stars were drowned.\n\r\nAt the third time he caught it; and she vanished,\r\nWaving her hand, a little floating moth,\r\nBetween the pine-trees, into the warm dark night.\r\nHe turned into his room, and quickly thrust\r\nUnder his pillow that forbidden fruit;\r\nFor the door opened, and the hot red face\r\nOf Otto Brahe, his father, glowered at him.\r\n\"What's this? What's this?\"\r\nThe furious-eyed old man\r\nLimped to the bedside, pulled the mystery out,\r\nAnd stared upon the strangest apple of Eve\r\nThat ever troubled Eden,--heavy as bronze,\r\nAnd delicately enchased with silver stars,\r\nThe small celestial globe that Tycho bought\r\nIn Leipzig.\r\nThen the storm burst on his head!\r\nThis moon-struck 'pothecary's-prenticework,\r\nThese cheap-jack calendar-maker's gypsy tricks\r\nWould damn the mother of any Knutsdorp squire,\r\nAnd crown his father like a stag of ten.\r\nQuarrel on quarrel followed from that night,\r\nTill Tycho sickened of his ancient name;\r\nAnd, wandering through the woods about his home,\r\nFound on a hill-top, ringed with fragrant pines,\r\nA little open glade of whispering ferns.\r\nThither, at night, he stole to watch the stars;\r\nAnd there he told the oldest tale on earth\r\nTo one that watched beside him, one whose eyes\r\nShone with true love, more beautiful than the stars,\r\nA daughter of earth, the peasant-girl, Christine.\n\r\nThey met there, in the dusk, on his last night\r\nAt home, before he went to Wittenberg.\r\nThey stood knee-deep among the whispering ferns,\r\nAnd said good-bye.\r\n \"I shall return,\" he said,\r\n\"And shame them for their folly, who would set\r\nTheir pride above the stars, Christine, and you.\r\nAt Wittenberg or Rostoch I shall find\r\nMore chances and more knowledge. All those worlds\r\nAre still to conquer. We know nothing yet;\r\nThe books are crammed with fables. They foretell\r\nHere an eclipse, and there a dawning moon,\r\nBut most of them were out a month or more\r\nOn Jupiter and Saturn.\r\n There's one way,\r\nAnd only one, to knowledge of the law\r\nWhereby the stars are steered, and so to read\r\nThe future, even perhaps the destinies\r\nOf men and nations,--only one sure way,\r\nAnd that's to watch them, watch them, and record\r\nThe truth we know, and not the lies we dream.\r\nDear, while I watch them, though the hills and sea\r\nDivide us, every night our eyes can meet\r\nAmong those constant glories. Every night\r\nYour eyes and mine, upraised to that bright realm,\r\nCan, in one moment, speak across the world.\r\nI shall come back with knowledge and with power,\r\nAnd you--will wait for me?\"\r\nShe answered him\r\nIn silence, with the starlight of her eyes.\n\n\n\n\r\nII\n\n\r\nHe watched the skies at Wittenberg. The plague\r\nDrove him to Rostoch, and he watched them there;\r\nBut, even there, the plague of little minds\r\nBeset him. At a wedding-feast he met\r\nHis noble countryman, Manderup, who asked,\r\nWith mocking courtesy, whether Tycho Brahe\r\nWas ready yet to practise his black art\r\nAt country fairs. The guests, and Tycho, laughed;\r\nWhereat the swaggering Junker blandly sneered,\r\n\"If fortune-telling fail, Christine will dance,\r\nThus--tambourine on hip,\" he struck a pose.\r\n\"Her pretty feet will pack that booth of yours.\"\r\nThey fought, at midnight, in a wood, with swords.\r\nAnd not a spark of light but those that leapt\r\nBlue from the clashing blades. Tycho had lost\r\nHis moon and stars awhile, almost his life;\r\nFor, in one furious bout, his enemy's blade\r\nDashed like a scribble of lightning into the face\r\nOf Tycho Brahe, and left him spluttering blood,\r\nGroping through that dark wood with outstretched hands,\r\nTo fall in a death-black swoon.\r\nThey carried him back\r\nTo Rostoch; and when Tycho saw at last\r\nThat mirrored patch of mutilated flesh,\r\nSeared as by fire, between the frank blue eyes\r\nAnd firm young mouth where, like a living flower\r\nUpon some stricken tree, youth lingered still,\r\nHe'd but one thought, Christine would shrink from him\r\nIn fear, or worse, in pity. An end had come\r\nWorse than old age, to all the glory of youth.\r\nUrania would not let her lover stray\r\nInto a mortal's arms. He must remain\r\nHer own, for ever; and for ever, alone.\n\r\nYet, as the days went by, to face the world,\r\nHe made himself a delicate mask of gold\r\nAnd silver, shaped like those that minstrels wear\r\nAt carnival in Venice, or when love,\r\nDisguising its disguise of mortal flesh,\r\nWooes as a nameless prince from far away.\r\nAnd when this world's day, with its blaze and coil\r\nWas ended, and the first white star awoke\r\nIn that pure realm where all our tumults die,\r\nHis eyes and hers, meeting on Hesperus,\r\nRenewed their troth.\r\n He seemed to see Christine,\r\nRinged by the pine-trees on that distant hill,\r\nA small white figure, lost in space and time,\r\nYet gazing at the sky, and conquering all,\r\nHeight, depth, and heaven itself, by the sheer power\r\nOf love at one with everlasting laws,\r\nA love that shared the constancy of heaven,\r\nAnd spoke to him across, above, the world.\n\n\n\n\r\nIII\n\n\r\nNot till he crossed the Danube did he find\r\nAmong the fountains and the storied eaves\r\nOf Augsburg, one to share his task with him.\r\nPaul Hainzel, of that city, greatly loved\r\nTo talk with Tycho of the strange new dreams\r\nCopernicus had kindled. Did this earth\r\nMove? Was the sun the centre of our scheme?\r\nAnd Tycho told him, there is but one way\r\nTo know the truth, and that's to sweep aside\r\nAll the dark cobwebs of old sophistry,\r\nAnd watch and learn that moving alphabet,\r\nEach smallest silver character inscribed\r\nUpon the skies themselves, noting them down,\r\nTill on a day we find them taking shape\r\nIn phrases, with a meaning; and, at last,\r\nThe hard-won beauty of that celestial book\r\nWith all its epic harmonies unfold\r\nLike some great poet's universal song.\n\r\nHe was a great magician, Tycho Brahe.\r\n\"Hainzel,\" he said, \"we have no magic wand,\r\nBut what the truth can give us. If we find\r\nEven with a compass, through a bedroom window,\r\nThat half the glittering Almagest is wrong,\r\nThink you, what noble conquests might be ours,\r\nHad we but nobler instruments.\"\r\nHe showed\r\nQuivering with eagerness, his first rude plan\r\nFor that great quadrant,--not the wooden toy\r\nOf old Scultetus, but a kingly weapon,\r\nHuge as a Roman battering-ram, and fine\r\nIn its divisions as any goldsmith's work.\r\n\"It could be built,\" said Tycho, \"but the cost\r\nWould buy a dozen culverin for your wars.\"\r\nThen Hainzel, fired by Tycho's burning brain,\r\nAnswered, \"We'll make it We've a war to wage\r\nOn Chaos, and his kingdoms of the night.\"\r\nThey chose the cunningest artists of the town,\r\nClock-makers, jewellers, carpenters, and smiths,\r\nAnd, setting them all afire with Tycho's dream,\r\nWithin a month his dream was oak and brass.\r\nIts beams were fourteen cubits, solid oak,\r\nBanded with iron. Its arch was polished brass\r\nWhereon five thousand exquisite divisions\r\nWere marked to show the minutes of degrees.\n\r\nSo huge and heavy it was, a score of men,\r\nCould hardly drag and fix it to its place\r\nIn Hainzel's garden.\r\n Many a shining night,\r\nTycho and Hainzel, out of that maze of flowers,\r\nCharted the stars, discovering point by point,\r\nHow all the records erred, until the fame\r\nOf this new master, hovering above the schools\r\nLike a strange hawk, threatened the creeping dreams\r\nOf all the Aristotelians, and began\r\nTo set their mouse-holes twittering \"Tycho Brahe!\"\n\r\nThen Tycho Brahe came home, to find Christine.\r\nUp to that whispering glade of ferns he sped,\r\nAt the first wink of Hesperus.\r\nHe stood\r\nIn shadow, under the darkest pine, to hide\r\nThe little golden mask upon his face.\r\nHe wondered, will she shrink from me in fear\r\nOr loathing? Will she even come at all?\r\nAnd, as he wondered, like a light she moved\r\nBefore him.\r\n\"Is it you?\"--\r\n \"Christine! Christine,\"\r\nHe whispered, \"It is I, the mountebank,\r\nPlaying a jest upon you. It's only a mask!\r\nDo not be frightened. I am here behind it.\"\n\r\nHer red lips parted, and between them shone,\r\nThe little teeth like white pomegranate seeds.\r\nHe saw her frightened eyes.\r\nThen, with a cry,\r\nHer arms went round him, and her eyelids closed.\r\nLying against his heart, she set her lips\r\nAgainst his lips, and claimed him for her own.\n\n\n\n\r\nIV\n\n\r\nOne frosty night, as Tycho bent his way\r\nHome to the dark old abbey, he upraised\r\nHis eyes, and saw a portent in the sky.\r\nThere, in its most familiar patch of blue,\r\nWhere Cassiopeia's five-fold glory burned,\r\nAn unknown brilliance quivered, a huge star\r\nUnseen before, a strange new visitant\r\nTo heavens unchangeable, as the world believed,\r\nSince the creation.\r\nCould new stars be born?\r\nNight after night he watched that miracle\r\nGrowing and changing colour as it grew;\r\nWhite at the first, and large as Jupiter;\r\nAnd, in the third month, yellow, and larger yet;\r\nRed in the fifth month, like Aldebaran,\r\nAnd larger even than Lyra. In the seventh,\r\nBluish like Saturn; whence it dulled and dwined\r\nLittle by little, till after eight months more\r\nInto the dark abysmal blue of night,\r\nWhence it arose, the wonder died away.\r\nBut, while it blazed above him, Tycho brought\r\nThose delicate records of two hundred nights\r\nTo Copenhagen. There, in his golden mask,\r\nAt supper with Pratensis, who believed\r\nOnly what old books told him, Tycho met\r\nDancey, the French Ambassador, rainbow-gay\r\nIn satin hose and doublet, supple and thin,\r\nBrown-eyed, and bearded with a soft black tuft\r\nNeat as a blackbird's wing,--a spirit as keen\r\nAnd swift as France on all the starry trails\r\nOf thought.\r\nHe saw the deep and simple fire,\r\nThe mystery of all genius in those eyes\r\nAbove that golden wizard.\r\nTycho raised\r\nHis wine-cup, brimming--they thought--with purple dreams;\r\nAnd bade them drink to their triumphant Queen\r\nOf all the Muses, to their Lady of Light\r\nUrania, and the great new star.\r\nThey laughed,\r\nThinking the young astrologer's golden mask\r\nHid a sardonic jest.\r\n \"The skies are clear,\"\r\nSaid Tycho Brahe, \"and we have eyes to see.\r\nPut out your candles. Open those windows there!\"\r\nThe colder darkness breathed upon their brows,\r\nAnd Tycho pointed, into the deep blue night.\r\nThere, in their most immutable height of heaven,\r\nIn ipso caelo, in the ethereal realm,\r\nBeyond all planets, red as Mars it burned,\r\nThe one impossible glory.\r\n\"But it's true!\"\r\nPratensis gasped; then, clutching the first straw,\r\n\"Now I recall how Pliny the Elder said,\r\nHipparchus also saw a strange new star,\r\nNot where the comets, not where the Rosae bloom\r\nAnd fade, but in that solid crystal sphere\r\nWhere nothing changes.\"\r\nTycho smiled, and showed\r\nThe record of his watchings.\r\n \"But the world\r\nMust know all this,\" cried Dancey. \"You must print it.\"\r\n\"Print it?\" said Tycho, turning that golden mask\r\nOn both his friends. \"Could I, a noble, print\r\nThis trafficking with Urania in a book?\r\nThey'd hound me out of Denmark! This disgrace\r\nOf work, with hands or brain, no matter why,\r\nNo matter how, in one who ought to dwell\r\nFixed to the solid upper sphere, my friends,\r\nWould never be forgiven.\"\r\nDancey stared\r\nIn mute amazement, but that mask of gold\r\nOutstared him, sphinx-like, and inscrutable.\n\r\nSoon through all Europe, like the blinded moths,\r\nRoused by a lantern in old palaces\r\nAmong the mouldering tapestries of thought,\r\nWeird fables woke and fluttered to and fro,\r\nAnd wild-eyed sages hunted them for truth.\r\nThe Italian, Frangipani, thought the star\r\nThe lost Electra, that had left her throne\r\nAmong the Pleiads, and plunged into the night\r\nLike a veiled mourner, when Troy town was burned.\r\nThe German painter, Busch, of Erfurt, wrote,\r\n\"It was a comet, made of mortal sins;\r\nA poisonous mist, touched by the wrath of God\r\nTo fire; from which there would descend on earth\r\nAll manner of evil--plagues and sudden death,\r\nFrenchmen and famine.\"\r\n Preachers thumped and raved.\r\nTheodore Beza in Calvin's pulpit tore\r\nHis grim black gown, and vowed it was the Star\r\nThat led the Magi. It had now returned\r\nTo mark the world's end and the Judgment Day.\r\nThen, in this hubbub, Dancey told the king\r\nOf Denmark, \"There is one who knows the truth--\r\nYour subject Tycho Brahe, who, night by night,\r\nWatched and recorded all that truth could see.\r\nIt would bring honour to all Denmark, sire,\r\nIf Tycho could forget his rank awhile,\r\nAnd print these great discoveries in a book,\r\nFor all the world to read.\"\r\nSo Tycho Brahe\r\nReceived a letter in the king's own hand,\r\nUrging him, \"Truth is the one pure fountain-head\r\nOf all nobility. Pray forget your rank.\"\r\nHis noble kinsmen echoed, \"If you wish\r\nTo please His Majesty and ourselves, forget\r\nYour rank.\"\r\n\"I will,\" said Tycho Brahe;\r\n\"Your reasoning has convinced me. I will print\r\nMy book, 'De Nova Stella.' And to prove\r\nAll you have said concerning temporal rank\r\nAnd this eternal truth you love so well,\r\nI marry, to-day,\"--they foamed, but all their mouths\r\nWere stopped and stuffed and sealed with their own words,--\r\n\"I marry to-day my own true love, Christine.\"\n\n\n\n\r\nV\n\n\r\nThey thought him a magician, Tycho Brahe.\r\nPerhaps he was. There's magic all around us\r\nIn rocks and trees, and in the minds of men,\r\nDeep hidden springs of magic.\r\nHe that strikes\r\nThe rock aright, may find them where he will.\n\r\nAnd Tycho tasted happiness in his hour.\r\nThere was a prince in Denmark in those days;\r\nAnd, when he heard how other kings desired\r\nThe secrets of this new astrology,\r\nHe said, \"This man, in after years, will bring\r\nGlory to Denmark, honour to her prince.\r\nHe is a Dane. Give him this isle of Wheen,\r\nAnd let him make his great discoveries there.\r\nLet him have gold to buy his instruments,\r\nAnd build his house and his observatory.\"\n\r\nSo Tycho set this island where he lived\r\nWhispering with wizardry; and, in its heart,\r\nHe lighted that strange lanthorn of the law,\r\nAnd built himself that wonder of the world,\r\nUraniborg, a fortress for the truth,\r\nA city of the heavens.\r\n Around it ran\r\nA mighty rampart twenty-two feet high,\r\nAnd twenty feet in thickness at the base.\r\nIts angles pointed north, south, east and west,\r\nWith gates and turrets; and, within this wall,\r\nWere fruitful orchards, apple, and cherry, and pear;\r\nAnd, sheltered in their midst from all but sun,\r\nA garden, warm and busy with singing bees.\r\nThere, many an hour, his flaxen-haired Christine,\r\nSang to her child, her first-born, Magdalen,\r\nOr watched her playing, a flower among the flowers.\r\nDark in the centre of that zone of bliss\r\nArose the magic towers of Tycho Brahe.\r\nTwo of them had great windows in their roofs\r\nOpening upon the sky where'er he willed,\r\nAnd under these observatories he made\r\nA library of many a golden book;\r\nPoets and sages of old Greece and Rome,\r\nAnd many a mellow legend, many a dream\r\nOf dawning truth in Egypt, or the dusk\r\nOf Araby. Under all of these he made\r\nA subterranean crypt for alchemy,\r\nWith sixteen furnaces; and, under this,\r\nHe sank a well, so deep, that Jeppe declared\r\nHe had tapped the central fountains of the world,\r\nAnd drew his magic from those cold clear springs.\r\nThis was the very well, said Jeppe, the dwarf,\r\nWhere Truth was hidden; but, by Tycho Brahe\r\nAnd his weird skill, the magic water flowed,\r\nThrough pipes, uphill, to all the house above:\r\nThe kitchen where his cooks could broil a trout\r\nFor sages or prepare a feast for kings;\r\nThe garrets for the students in the roof;\r\nThe guest-rooms, and the red room to the north,\r\nThe study and the blue room to the south;\r\nThe small octagonal yellow room that held\r\nThe sunlight like a jewel all day long,\r\nAnd Magdalen, with her happy dreams, at night;\r\nThen, facing to the west, one long green room,\r\nThe ceiling painted like the bower of Eve\r\nWith flowers and leaves, the windows opening wide\r\nThrough which Christine and Tycho Brahe at dawn\r\nCould see the white sails drifting on the Sound\r\nLike petals from their orchard.\r\nTo the north,\r\nHe built a printing house for noble books,\r\nPoems, and those deep legends of the sky,\r\nStill to be born at his Uraniborg.\r\nBeyond the rampart to the north arose\r\nA workshop for his instruments. To the south\r\nA low thatched farm-house rambled round a yard\r\nAlive with clucking hens; and, further yet\r\nTo southward on another hill, he made\r\nA great house for his larger instruments,\r\nAnd called it Stiernborg, mountain of the stars.\n\r\nAnd, on his towers and turrets, Tycho set\r\nStatues with golden verses in the praise\r\nOf famous men, the bearers of the torch,\r\nFrom Ptolemy to the new Copernicus.\r\nThen, in that storm-proof mountain of the stars,\r\nHe set in all their splendour of new-made brass\r\nHis armouries for the assault of heaven,--\r\nCircles in azimuth, armillary spheres,\r\nRevolving zodiacs with great brazen rings;\r\nQuadrants of solid brass, ten cubits broad,\r\nBrass parallactic rules, made to revolve\r\nIn azimuth; clocks with wheels; an astrolabe;\r\nAnd that large globe strengthened by oaken beams\r\nHe made at Augsburg.\r\n All his gold he spent;\r\nBut Denmark had a prince in those great days;\r\nAnd, in his brain, the dreams of Tycho Brahe\r\nKindled a thirst for glory. So he made\r\nTycho the Lord of sundry lands and rents,\r\nAnd Keeper of the Chapel where the kings\r\nOf Oldenburg were buried; for he said\r\n\"To whom could all these kings entrust their bones\r\nMore fitly than to him who read the stars,\r\nAnd though a mortal, knew immortal laws;\r\nAnd paced, at night, the silent halls of heaven.\"\n\n\n\n\r\nVI\n\n\r\nHe was a great magician, Tycho Brahe.\r\nThere, on his island, for a score of years,\r\nHe watched the skies, recording star on star,\r\nFor future ages, and, by patient toil,\r\nPerfected his great tables of the sun,\r\nThe moon, the planets.\r\n There, too happy far\r\nFor any history, sons and daughters rose,\r\nA little clan of love, around Christine;\r\nAnd Tycho thought, when I am dead, my sons\r\nWill rule and work in my Uraniborg.\r\nAnd yet a doubt would trouble him, for he knew\r\nThe children of Christine would still be held\r\nIgnoble, by the world.\r\n Disciples came,\r\nYoung-eyed and swift, the bearers of the torch\r\nFrom many a city to Uraniborg,\r\nAnd Tycho Brahe received them like a king,\r\nAnd bade them light their torches at his fire.\r\nThe King of Scotland came, with all his court,\r\nAnd dwelt eight days in Tycho Brahe's domain,\r\nAsking him many a riddle, deep and dark,\r\nWhose answer, none the less, a king should know.\r\nWhat boots it on this earth to be a king,\r\nTo rule a part of earth, and not to know\r\nThe worth of his own realm, whether he rule\r\nAs God's vice-gerent, and his realm be still\r\nThe centre of the centre of all worlds;\r\nOr whether, as Copernicus proclaimed,\r\nThis earth itself be moving, a lost grain\r\nOf dust among the innumerable stars?\r\nFor this would dwarf all glory but the soul,\r\nIn king or peasant, that can hail the truth,\r\nThough truth should slay it.\r\n So to Tycho Brahe,\r\nThe king became a subject for eight days.\r\nBut, in the crowded hall, when he had gone,\r\nJeppe raised his matted head, with a chuckle of glee,\r\nQuiet as the gurgle of joy in a dark rock-pool,\r\nWhen the first ripple and wash of the first spring-tide\r\nFlows bubbling under the dry sun-blackened fringe\r\nOf seaweed, setting it all afloat again,\r\nIn magical colours, like a merman's hair.\r\n\"Jeppe has a thought,\" the gay young students cried,\r\nThronging him round, for all believed that Jeppe\r\nWas fey, and had strange visions of the truth.\r\n\"What is the thought, Jeppe?\"\r\n\"I can think no thoughts,\"\r\nCroaked Jeppe. \"But I have made myself a song.\"\r\n\"Silence,\" they cried, \"for Jeppe the nightingale!\r\nSing, Jeppe!\"\r\nAnd, wagging his great head to and fro\r\nBefore the fire, with deep dark eyes, he crooned:\n\r\nTHE SONG OF JEPPE\n\r\n\"What!\" said the king,\r\n \"Is earth a bird or bee?\r\n Can this uncharted boundless realm of ours\r\nDrone thro' the sky, with leagues of struggling sea,\r\nForests, and hills, and towns, and palace-towers?\"\r\n \"Ay,\" said the dwarf,\r\n \"I have watched from Stiernborg's crown\r\nHer far dark rim uplift against the sky;\r\nBut, while earth soars, men say the starsgo down;\r\nAnd, while earth sails, men say the stars go by.\"\r\nAn elvish tale!\r\nAsk Jeppe, the dwarf! He knows.\r\nThat's why his eyes look fey; for, chuckling deep,\r\nHeels over head amongst the stars he goes,\r\nAs all men go; but most are sound asleep.\r\nKing, saint, sage,\r\nEven those that count it true,\r\nAct as this miracle touched them not at all.\r\nThey are borne, undizzied, thro' the rushing blue,\r\nAnd build their empires on a sky-tossed ball.\n\r\nThen said the king,\r\n\"If earth so lightly move,\r\nWhat of my realm? O, what shall now stand sure?\"\r\n\"Naught,\" said the dwarf, \"in all this world, but love.\r\nAll else is dream-stuff and shall not endure.\r\n'Tis nearer now!\r\nOur universe hath no centre,\r\nOur shadowy earth and fleeting heavens no stay,\r\nBut that deep inward realm which each can enter,\r\nEven Jeppe, the dwarf, by his own secret way.\"\n\r\n\"Where?\" said the king,\r\n\"O, where? I have not found it!\"\r\n\"Here,\" said the dwarf, and music echoed \"here.\"\r\n\"This infinite circle hath no line to bound it;\r\nTherefore that deep strange centre is everywhere.\r\nLet the earth soar thro' heaven, that centre abideth;\r\nOr plunge to the pit, His covenant still holds true.\r\nIn the heart of a dying bird, the Master hideth;\r\nIn the soul of a king,\" said the dwarf,\r\n\"and in my soul, too.\"\n\n\n\n\r\nVII\n\n\r\nPrinces and courtiers came, a few to seek\r\nA little knowledge, many more to gape\r\nIn wonder at Tycho's gold and silver mask;\r\nOr when they saw the beauty of his towers,\r\nEnvy and hate him for them.\r\nThus arose\r\nThe small grey cloud upon the distant sky,\r\nThat broke in storm at last.\r\n \"Beware,\" croaked Jeppe,\r\nLifting his shaggy head beside the fire,\r\nWhen guests like these had gone, \"Master, beware!\"\r\nAnd Tycho of the frank blue eyes would laugh.\r\nEven when he found Witichius playing him false\r\nHis anger, like a momentary breeze,\r\nDied on the dreaming deep; for Tycho Brahe\r\nTurned to a nobler riddle,--\"Have you thought,\"\r\nHe asked his young disciples, \"how the sea\r\nIs moved to that strange rhythm we call the tides?\r\nHe that can answer this shall have his name\r\nHonoured among the bearers of the torch\r\nWhile Pegasus flies above Uraniborg.\r\nI was delayed three hours or more to-day\r\nBy the neap-tide. The fishermen on the coast\r\nAre never wrong. They time it by the moon.\r\nPost hoc, perhaps, not propter hoc; and yet\r\nThrough all the changes of the sky and sea\r\nThat old white clock of ours with the battered face\r\nDoes seem infallible.\r\nThere's a love-song too,\r\nThe sailors on the coast of Sweden sing,\r\nI have often pondered it. Your courtly poets\r\nUpbraid the inconstant moon. But these men know\r\nThe moon and sea are lovers, and they move\r\nIn a most constant measure. Hear the words\r\nAnd tell me, if you can, what silver chains\r\nBind them together.\" Then, in a voice as low\r\nAnd rhythmical as the sea, he spoke that song:\n\r\nTHE SHEPHERDESS OF THE SEA\n\r\nReproach not yet our sails' delay;\r\nYou cannot see the shoaling bay,\r\nThe banks of sand, the fretful bars,\r\nThat ebb left naked to the stars.\r\nThe sea's white shepherdess, the moon,\r\nShall lead us into harbour soon.\n\r\nDear, when you see her glory shine\r\nBetween your fragrant boughs of pine,\r\nKnow there is but one hour to wait\r\nBefore her hands unlock the gate,\r\nAnd the full flood of singing foam\r\nFollow her lovely footsteps home.\n\r\nThen waves like flocks of silver sheep\r\nCome rustling inland from the deep,\r\nAnd into rambling valleys press\r\nBehind their heavenly shepherdess.\r\nYou cannot see them? Lift your eyes\r\nAnd see their mistress in the skies.\r\nShe rises with her silver bow.\n\r\nI feel the tide begin to flow;\r\nAnd every thought and hope and dream\r\nFollow her call, and homeward stream.\r\nBorne on the universal tide,\r\nThe wanderer hastens to his bride.\r\nThe sea's white shepherdess, the moon,\r\nShall lead him into harbour, soon.\n\n\n\n\r\nVIII\n\n\r\nHe was a great magician, Tycho Brahe,\r\nBut not so great that he could read the heart\r\nOr rule the hand of princes.\r\n When his friend\r\nKing Frederick died, the young Prince Christian reigned;\r\nAnd, round him, fool and knave made common cause\r\nAgainst the magic that could pour their gold\r\nInto a gulf of stars. This Tycho Brahe\r\nHad grown too proud. He held them in contempt,\r\nSo they believed; for, when he spoke, their thoughts\r\nCrept at his feet like spaniels. Junkerdom\r\nFelt it was foolish, for he towered above it,\r\nAnd so it hated him. Did he not spend\r\nGold that a fool could spend as quickly as he?\r\nWere there not great estates bestowed upon him\r\nIn wisdom's name, that from the dawn of time\r\nHad been the natural right of Junkerdom?\r\nAnd would he not bequeath them to his heirs,\r\nThe children of Christine, an unfree woman?\r\n\"Why you, sire, even you,\" they told the king,\r\n\"He has made a laughing-stock. That horoscope\r\nHe read for you, the night when you were born,\r\nPrinted, and bound it in green velvet, too,--\r\nRead it The whole world laughs at it. He said\r\nThat Venus was the star that ruled your fate,\r\nAnd Venus would destroy you. Tycho Brahe\r\nInspired your royal father with the fear\r\nThat kept your youth so long in leading-strings,\r\nThe fear that every pretty hedgerow flower\r\nWould be your Circe. So he thought to avenge\r\nOur mockery of this peasant-girl Christine,\r\nTo whom, indeed, he plays the faithful swine,\r\nKnowing full well his gold and silver nose\r\nWould never win another.\"\r\nThus the sky\r\nDarkened above Uraniborg, and those\r\nWho dwelt within it, till one evil day,\r\nOne seeming happy day, when Tycho marked\r\nThe seven-hundredth star upon his chart,\r\nTwo pompous officers from Walchendorp,\r\nThe chancellor, knocked at Tycho's eastern gate.\r\n\"We are sent,\" they said, \"to see and to report\r\nWhat use you make of these estates of yours.\r\nYour alchemy has turned more gold to lead\r\nThan Denmark can approve. The uses now!\r\nShow us the uses of this work of yours.\"\r\nThen Tycho showed his tables of the stars,\r\nSeven hundred stars, each noted in its place\r\nWith exquisite precision, the result\r\nOf watching heaven for five-and-twenty years.\r\n\"And is this all?\" they said.\r\nThey sought to invent\r\nSome ground for damning him. The truth alone\r\nWould serve them, as it seemed. For these were men\r\nWho could not understand.\r\n\"Not all, I hope,\"\r\nSaid Tycho, \"for I think, before I die,\r\nI shall have marked a thousand.\"\r\n \"To what end?\r\nWhen shall we reap the fruits of all this toil?\r\nShow us its uses.\"\r\n \"In the time to come,\"\r\nSaid Tycho Brahe, \"perhaps a hundred years,\r\nPerhaps a thousand, when our own poor names\r\nAre quite forgotten, and our kingdoms dust,\r\nOn one sure certain day, the torch-bearers\r\nWill, at some point of contact, see a light\r\nMoving upon this chaos. Though our eyes\r\nBe shut for ever in an iron sleep,\r\nTheir eyes shall see the kingdom of the law,\r\nOur undiscovered cosmos. They shall see it--\r\nA new creation rising from the deep,\r\nBeautiful, whole.\r\nWe are like men that hear\r\nDisjointed notes of some supernal choir.\r\nYear after year, we patiently record\r\nAll we can gather. In that far-off time,\r\nA people that we have not known shall hear them,\r\nMoving like music to a single end.\"\n\r\nThey could not understand: this life that sought\r\nOnly to bear the torch and hand it on;\r\nAnd so they made report that all the dreams\r\nOf Tycho Brahe were fruitless; perilous, too,\r\nSince he avowed that any fruit they bore\r\nWould fall, in distant years, to alien hands.\n\r\nLittle by little, Walchendorp withdrew\r\nHis rents from Tycho Brahe, accusing him\r\nOf gross neglects. The Chapel at Roskilde\r\nWas falling into ruin. Tycho Brahe\r\nWas Keeper of the Bones of Oldenburg.\r\nHe must rebuild the Chapel. All the gifts\r\nThat Frederick gave to help him in his task,\r\nWere turned to stumbling-blocks; till, one dark day,\r\nHe called his young disciples round him there,\r\nAnd in that mellow library of dreams,\r\nLit by the dying sunset, poured his heart\r\nAnd mind before them, bidding them farewell.\r\nThrough the wide-open windows as he spoke\r\nThey heard the sorrowful whisper of the sea\r\nEbbing and flowing around Uraniborg.\r\n\"An end has come,\" he said, \"to all we planned.\r\nUraniborg has drained her treasury dry.\r\nYour Alma Mater now must close her gates\r\nOn you, her guests; on me; and, worst of all,\r\nOn one most dear, who made this place my home.\r\nFor you are young, your homes are all to win,\r\nAnd you would all have gone your separate ways\r\nIn a brief while; and, though I think you love\r\nYour college of the skies, it could not mean\r\nAll that it meant to those who called it 'home.'\n\r\nYou that have worked with me, for one brief year,\r\nWill never quite forget Uraniborg.\r\nThis room, the sunset gilding all those books,\r\nThe star-charts and that old celestial globe,\r\nThe long bright evenings by the winter fire,\r\nOf Tycho Brahe were fruitless; perilous\r\nThe talk that opened heaven, the songs you sung,\r\nYes, even, I think, the tricks you played with Jeppe,\r\nWill somehow, when yourselves are growing old,\r\nBe hallowed into beauty, touched with tears,\r\nFor you will wish they might be yours again.\n\r\nThese have been mine for five-and-twenty years,\r\nAnd more than these,--the work, the dreams I shared\r\nWith you, and others here. My heart will break\r\nTo leave them. But the appointed time has come\r\nAs it must come to all men.\r\nYou and I\r\nHave watched too many constant stars to dream\r\nThat heaven or earth, the destinies of men\r\nOr nations, are the sport of chance. An end\r\nComes to us all through blindness, age, or death.\r\nIf mine must come in exile, it stall find me\r\nBearing the torch as far as I can bear it,\r\nUntil I fall at the feet of the young runner,\r\nWho takes it from me, and carries it out of sight,\r\nInto the great new age I shall not know,\r\nInto the great new realms I must not tread.\r\nCome, then, swift-footed, let me see you stand\r\nWaiting before me, crowned with youth and joy,\r\nAt the next turning. Take it from my hand,\r\nFor I am almost ready now to fall.\n\r\nSomething I have achieved, yes, though I say it,\r\nI have not loitered on that fiery way.\r\nAnd if I front the judgment of the wise\r\nIn centuries to come, with more of dread\r\nThan my destroyers, it is because this work\r\nWill be of use, remembered and appraised,\r\nWhen all their hate is dead.\r\n I say the work,\r\nNot the blind rumour, the glory or fame of it.\r\nThese observations of seven hundred stars\r\nAre little enough in sight of those great hosts\r\nWhich nightly wheel around us, though I hope,\r\nYes, I still hope, in some more generous land\r\nTo make my thousand up before I die.\r\nLittle enough, I know,--a midget's work!\r\nThe men that follow me, with more delicate art\r\nMay add their tens of thousands; yet my sum\r\nWill save them just that five-and-twenty years\r\nOf patience, bring them sooner to their goal,\r\nThat kingdom of the law I shall not see.\r\nWe are on the verge of great discoveries.\r\nI feel them as a dreamer feels the dawn\r\nBefore his eyes are opened. Many of you\r\nWill see them. In that day you will recall\r\nThis, our last meeting at Uraniborg,\r\nAnd how I told you that this work of ours\r\nWould lead to victories for the coming age.\r\nThe victors may forget us. What of that?\r\nTheirs be the palms, the shouting, and the praise.\r\nOurs be the fathers' glory in the sons.\r\nOurs the delight of giving, the deep joy\r\nOf labouring, on the cliff's face, all night long,\r\nCutting them foot-holes in the solid rock,\r\nWhereby they climb so gaily to the heights,\r\nAnd gaze upon their new-discovered worlds.\r\nYou will not find me there. When you descend,\r\nLook for me in the darkness at the foot\r\nOf those high cliffs, under the drifted leaves.\r\nThat's where we hide at last, we pioneers,\r\nFor we are very proud, and must be sought\r\nBefore the world can find us, in our graves.\r\nThere have been compensations. I have seen\r\nIn darkness, more perhaps than eyes can see\r\nWhen sunlight blinds them on the mountain-tops;\r\nGuessed at a glory past our mortal range,\r\nAnd only mine because the night was mine.\n\r\nOf those three systems of the universe,\r\nThe Ptolemaic, held by all the schools,\r\nMay yet be proven false. We yet may find\r\nThis earth of ours is not the sovran lord\r\nOf all those wheeling spheres. Ourselves have marked\r\nMovements among the planets that forbid\r\nAcceptance of it wholly. Some of these\r\nAre moving round the sun, if we can trust\r\nOur years of watching. There are stranger dreams.\r\nThis radical, Copernicus, the priest,\r\nOf whom I often talked with you, declares\r\nAil of these movements can be reconciled,\r\nIf--a hypothesis only--we should take\r\nThe sun itself for centre, and assume\r\nThat this huge earth, so 'stablished, so secure\r\nIn its foundations, is a planet also,\r\nAnd moves around the sun.\r\nI cannot think it.\r\nThis leap of thought is yet too great for me.\r\nI have no doubt that Ptolemy was wrong.\r\nSome of his planets move around the sun.\r\nCopernicus is nearer to the truth\r\nIn some things. But the planets we have watched\r\nStill wander from the course that he assigned.\r\nTherefore, my system, which includes the best\r\nOf both, I hold may yet be proven true.\r\nThis earth of ours, as Jeppe declared one day,\r\nSo simply that we laughed, is 'much too big\r\nTo move,' so let it be the centre still,\r\nAnd let the planets move around their sun;\r\nBut let the sun with all its planets move\r\nAround our central earth.\r\nThis at the least\r\nAccords with all we know, and saves mankind\r\nFrom that enormous plunge into the night;\r\nSaves them from voyaging for ten thousand years\r\nThrough boundless darkness without sight of land;\r\nSaves them from all that agony of loss,\r\nAs one by one the beacon-fires of faith\r\nAre drowned in blackness.\r\nI beseech you, then,\r\nLet me be proven wrong, before you take\r\nThat darkness lightly. If at last you find\r\nThe proven facts against me, take the plunge.\r\nLaunch out into that darkness. Let the lamps\r\nOf heaven, the glowing hearth-fires that we knew\r\nDie out behind you, while the freshening wind\r\nBlows on your brows, and overhead you see\r\nThe stars of truth that lead you from your home.\n\r\nI love this island,--every little glen,\r\nHazel-wood, brook, and fish-pond; every bough\r\nAnd blossom in that garden; and I hoped\r\nTo die here. But it is not chance, I know,\r\nThat sends me wandering through the world again.\r\nMy use perhaps is ended; and the power\r\nThat made me, breaks me.\"\r\nAs he spoke, they saw\r\nThe tears upon his face. He bowed his head\r\nAnd left them silent in the darkened room.\r\nThey saw his face no more.\r\n The self-same hour,\r\nTycho, Christine, and all their children, left\r\nTheir island-home for even In their ship\r\nThey took a few of the smaller instruments,\r\nAnd that most precious record of the stars,\r\nHis legacy to the future. Into the night\r\nThey vanished, leaving on the ghostly cliffs\r\nOnly one dark, distorted, dog-like shape\r\nTo watch them, sobbing, under its matted hair,\r\n\"Master, have you forgotten Jeppe, your dwarf?\"\n\n\n\n\r\nIX\n\n\r\nHe was a great magician, Tycho Brahe,\r\nAnd yet his magic, under changing skies,\r\nCould never change his heart, or touch the hills\r\nOf those far countries with the tints of home.\r\nAnd, after many a month of wandering,\r\nHe came to Prague; and, though with open hands\r\nRodolphe received him, like an exiled king,\r\nA new Aeneas, exiled for the truth\r\n(For so they called him), none could heal the wounds\r\nThat bled within, or lull his grief to sleep\r\nWith that familiar whisper of the waves,\r\nEbbing and flowing around Uraniborg.\n\r\nDoggedly still he laboured; point by point,\r\nCrept on, with aching heart and burning brain,\r\nUntil his table of the stars had reached\r\nThe thousand that he hoped, to crown his toil.\r\nBut Christine heard him murmuring in the night,\r\n\"The work, the work! Not to have lived in vain!\r\nInto whose hands can I entrust it all?\r\nI thought to find him standing by the way,\r\nWaiting to seize the splendour from my hand,\r\nThe swift, young-eyed runner with the torch.\r\nLet me not live in vain, let me not fall\r\nBefore I yield it to the appointed soul.\"\r\nAnd yet the Power that made and broke him heard:\r\nFor, on a certain day, to Tycho came\r\nAnother exile, guided through the dark\r\nOf Europe by the starlight in his eyes,\r\nOr that invisible hand which guides the world.\r\nHe asked him, as the runner with the torch\r\nAlone could ask, asked as a natural right\r\nFor Tycho's hard-won life-work, those results,\r\nHis tables of the stars. He gave his name\r\nAlmost as one who told him, It is I;\r\nAnd yet unconscious that he told; a name\r\nNot famous yet, though truth had marked him out\r\nAlready, by his exile, as her own,--\r\nThe name of Johann Kepler.\r\n \"It was strange,\"\r\nWrote Kepler, not long after, \"for I asked\r\nUnheard-of things, and yet he gave them to me\r\nAs if I were his son. When first I saw him,\r\nWe seemed to have known each other years ago\r\nIn some forgotten world. I could not guess\r\nThat Tycho Brahe was dying. He was quick\r\nOf temper, and we quarrelled now and then,\r\nOnly to find ourselves more closely bound\r\nThan ever. I believe that Tycho died\r\nSimply of heartache for his native land.\r\nFor though he always met me with a smile,\r\nOr jest upon his lips, he could not sleep\r\nOr work, and often unawares I caught\r\nOdd little whispered phrases on his lips\r\nAs if he talked to himself, in a kind of dream.\r\nYet I believe the clouds dispersed a little\r\nAround his death-bed, and with that strange joy\r\nWhich comes in death, he saw the unchanging stars.\r\nChristine was there. She held him in her arms.\r\nI think, too, that he knew his work was safe.\r\nAn hour before he died, he smiled at me,\r\nAnd whispered,--what he meant I hardly know--\r\nPerhaps a broken echo from the past,\r\nA fragment of some old familiar thought,\r\nAnd yet I seemed to know. It haunts me still:\r\n'Come then, swift-footed, let me see you stand,\r\nWaiting before me, crowned with youth and joy;\r\nThis is the turning. Take it from my hand.\r\nFor I am ready, ready now, to fall.'\"",

we had no word, for firing.\r\nGrey in the gateway of St. Gond the Guard of the tyrant shone;\r\nDark with the fate of a falling star, retiring and retiring,\r\nThe Breton line went backward and the Breton tale went on.\n\r\n\"Her father had sailed across the sea\r\nFrom the harbour of Africa\r\nWhen all the slaves took up their tools\r\nFor the bidding of Barbara.\n\r\nShe smote the bare wall with her hand\r\nAnd bad them smite again;\r\nShe poured them wealth of wine and meat\r\nTo stay them in their pain.\n\r\nAnd cried through the lifted thunder\r\nOf thronging hammer and hod\r\n'Throw open the third window\r\nIn the third name of God.'\n\r\nThen the hearts failed and the tools fell,\r\nAnd far towards the foam,\r\nMen saw a shadow on the sands\r\nAnd her father coming home.\"\n\r\nSpeak low and low, along the line the whispered word is flying\r\nBefore the touch, before the time, we may not loose a breath:\r\nTheir guns must mash us to the mire and there be no replying,\r\nTill the hand is raised to fling us for the final dice to death.\n\r\n\"There were two windows in your tower,\r\nBarbara, Barbara,\r\nFor all between the sun and moon\r\nIn the lands of Africa.\n\r\nHath a man three eyes, Barbara,\r\nA bird three wings,\r\nThat you have riven roof and wall\r\nTo look upon vain things?\"\n\r\nHer voice was like a wandering thing\r\nThat falters yet is free,\r\nWhose soul has drunk in a distant land\r\nOf the rivers of liberty.\n\r\n\"There are more wings than the wind knows\r\nOr eyes than see the sun\r\nIn the light of the lost window\r\nAnd the wind of the doors undone.\n\r\nFor out of the first lattice\r\nAre the red lands that break\r\nAnd out of the second lattice\r\nSea like a green snake,\n\r\nBut out of the third lattice\r\nUnder low eaves like wings\r\nIs a new corner of the sky\r\nAnd the other side of things.\"\n\r\nIt opened in the inmost place an instant beyond uttering,\r\nA casement and a chasm and a thunder of doors undone,\r\nA seraph's strong wing shaken out the shock of its unshuttering,\r\nThat split the shattered sunlight from a light behind the sun.\n\r\n\"Then he drew sword and drave her\r\nWhere the judges sat and said\r\n'Caesar sits above the gods,\r\nBarbara the maid.\n\r\nCaesar hath made a treaty\r\nWith the moon and with the sun,\r\nAll the gods that men can praise\r\nPraise him every one.\n\r\nThere is peace with the anointed\r\nOf the scarlet oils of Bel,\r\nWith the Fish God, where the whirlpool\r\nIs a winding stair to hell,\n\r\nWith the pathless pyramids of slime,\r\nWhere the mitred negro lifts\r\nTo his black cherub in the cloud\r\nAbominable gifts,\n\r\nWith the leprous silver cities\r\nWhere the dumb priests dance and nod,\r\nBut not with the three windows\r\nAnd the last name of God.'\"\n\r\nThey are firing, we are falling, and the red skies rend and shiver us,\r\nBarbara, Barbara, we may not loose a breath--\r\nBe at the bursting doors of doom, and in the dark deliver us,\r\nWho loosen the last window on the sun of sudden death.\n\r\n\"Barbara the beautiful\r\nStood up as queen set free,\r\nWhose mouth is set to a terrible cup\r\nAnd the trumpet of liberty.\n\r\n'I have looked forth from a window\r\nThat no man now shall bar,\r\nCaesar's toppling battle-towers\r\nShall never stretch so far.\n\r\nThe slaves are dancing in their chains,\r\nThe child laughs at the rod,\r\nBecause of the bird of the three wings,\r\nAnd the third face of God.'\n\r\nThe sword upon his shoulder\r\nShifted and shone and fell,\r\nAnd Barbara lay very small\r\nAnd crumpled like a shell.\"\n\r\nWhat wall upon what hinges turned stands open like a door?\r\nToo simple for the sight of faith, too huge for human eyes,\r\nWhat light upon what ancient way shines to a far-off floor,\r\nThe line of the lost land of France or the plains of Paradise?\n\r\n\"Caesar smiled above the gods,\r\nHis lip of stone was curled,\r\nHis iron armies wound like chains\r\nRound and round the world,\n\r\nAnd the strong slayer of his own\r\nThat cut down flesh for grass,\r\nSmiled too, and went to his own tower\r\nLike a walking tower of brass,\n\r\nAnd the songs ceased and the slaves were dumb;\r\nAnd far towards the foam\r\nMen saw a shadow on the sands;\r\nAnd her father coming home....\n\r\nBlood of his blood upon the sword\r\nStood red but never dry.\r\nHe wiped it slowly, till the blade\r\nWas blue as the blue sky.\n\r\nBut the blue sky split with a thunder-crack,\r\nSpat down a blinding brand,\r\nAnd all of him lay back and flat\r\nAs his shadow on the sand.\"\n\r\nThe touch and the tornado; all our guns give tongue together\r\nSt. Barbara for the gunnery and God defend the right,\r\nThey are stopped and gapped and battered as we blast away the weather.\r\nBuilding window upon window to our lady of the light.\r\nFor the light is come on Liberty, her foes are falling, falling,\r\nThey are reeling, they are running, as the shameful years have run,\r\nShe is risen for all the humble, she has heard the conquered calling,\r\nSt. Barbara of the Gunners, with her hand upon the gun.\r\nThey are burst asunder in the midst that eat of their own flatteries,\r\nWhose lip is curled to order as its barbered hair is curled....\r\nBlast of the beauty of sudden death, St. Barbara of the batteries!\r\nThat blow the new white window in the wall of all the world.\n\r\nFor the hand is raised behind us, and the bolt smites hard\r\nThrough the rending of the doorways, through the death-gap of the Guard,\r\nFor the cry of the Three Colours is in Cond' and beyond\r\nAnd the Guard is flung for carrion in the graveyard of St. Gond,\r\nThrough Mondemont and out of it, through Morin marsh and on\r\nWith earthquake of salutation the impossible thing is gone,\r\nGaul, charioted and charging, great Gaul upon a gun,\r\nTip-toe on all her thousand years and trumpeting to the sun:\r\nAs day returns, as death returns, swung backwards and swung home,\r\nBack on the barbarous reign returns the battering-ram of Rome.\r\nWhile that that the east held hard and hot like pincers in a forge,\r\nCame like the west wind roaring up the cannon of St. George,\r\nWhere the hunt is up and racing over stream and swamp and tarn\r\nAnd their batteries, black with battle, hold the bridgeheads of the Marne\r\nAnd across the carnage of the Guard, by Paris in the plain,\r\nThe Normans to the Bretons cried and the Bretons cheered again....\r\nBut he that told the tale went home to his house beside the sea\r\nAnd burned before St. Barbara, the light of the windows three,\r\nThree candles for an unknown thing, never to come again,\r\nThat opened like the eye of God on Paris in the plain.",

I could not think but that a God grown old\r\nSaw in a dream or waking all this round of bold\r\nAnd wavelike hills, and knew them but a thought,\r\nOr but a wave uptost and poised awhile then caught\r\nBack to the sea with waves a million more\r\nThat rise and pause and break at last upon the shore.\r\nA God, a God saw first those hills that I\r\nSaw now immense upholding the starry crowded sky:\r\nHis breath the mist that clung their shoulders round,\r\nHis slow unconscious sigh that easeless floating sound.\r\nEre mine his thought failed under each rough height\r\nAnd then was brave, seeing the stars climb calm and bright.\r\nEre they were named he named them in his mood,\r\nLike varying children of one giant warring brood--\r\nBroad-Foot, Cloud-Gatherer, Long-Back, Winter-Head,\r\nBravery and Bright-Face and that long Home of the Dead;\r\nAnd their still waters glittering in his glance\r\nNamed Buckler, Silver Dish, Two Eyes and Shining Lance,\r\nNames unrecorded, but the circling wind\r\nRemembers and repeats them to the listening mind....\r\nThat mind was mine. At Shining Lance I stared\r\nBetween Long-Back and Winter-Head as the new sun bared\r\nThe Lake and heights of shadow and the wan gold\r\nDeepened and new warmth came into the light's sharp cold.\r\nAnd the near trees shivered no more but shook\r\nTheir music over Shining Lance; and the excited brook\r\nFreshened in the sun's eye and tossed his spray\r\nHigh and sparkling, and then sprang dancing, dancing away.\r\nBut Winter-Head and Long-Back, gravely bright,\r\nStood firm as if for ever and a day and a night--\r\nAs they were more than a wave before 'tis caught\r\nBack to the tossing tide, more than a flying thought,\r\nMore than a dream that an old God once dreamed\r\nWhen visionary not at all visionary seemed.",
          "She told the story, and the whole world wept\r\nAt wrongs and cruelties it had not known\r\nBut for this fearless woman's voice alone.\r\nShe spoke to consciences that long had slept:\r\nHer message, Freedom's clear reveille, swept\r\nFrom heedless hovel to complacent throne.\r\nCommand and prophecy were in the tone\r\nAnd from its sheath the sword of justice leapt.\r\nAround two peoples swelled a fiery wave,\r\nBut both came forth transfigured from the flame.\r\nBlest be the hand that dared be strong to save,\r\nAnd blest be she who in our weakness came--\r\nProphet and priestess! At one stroke she gave\r\nA race to freedom and herself to fame.",
          "If I were promised safety,\r\nif I could meet the Sultan\r\nI would say to him:O my lord the Sultan!\r\nmy cloak has been torn by your ravenous dogs,\r\nyour spies are following me all the time.\r\nTheir eyes\r\ntheir noses\r\ntheir feet are chasing me\r\nlike destiny, like fate\r\nThey interrogate my wife\r\nand write down all the names of my friends.\r\nO Sultan!\r\nBecause I dare to approach your deaf walls,\r\nbecause I tried to reveal my sadness and\r\ntribulation,\r\nI was beaten with my shoes.\r\nO my lord the Sultan!\r\nyou have lost the war twice\r\nbecause half our people\r\nhas no tongue.",
          "When I had dreamed and dreamed what woman's beauty was,\r\nAnd how that beauty seen from unseen surely flowed,\r\nI turned and dreamed again, but sleeping now no more:\r\nMy eyes shut and my mind with inward vision glowed.\n\r\n\"I did not think!\" I cried, seeing that wavering shape\r\nThat steadied and then wavered, as a cherry bough in June\r\nLifts and falls in the wind--each fruit a fruit of light;\r\nAnd then she stood as clear as an unclouded moon.\n\r\nAs clear and still she stood, moonlike remotely near;\r\nI saw and heard her breathe, I years and years away.\r\nHer light streamed through the years, I saw her clear and still,\r\nShape and spirit together mingling night with day.\n\r\nWater falling, falling with the curve of time\r\nOver green-hued rock, then plunging to its pool\r\nFar, far below, a falling spear of light;\r\nWater falling golden from the sun but moonlike cool:\n\r\nWater has the curve of her shoulder and breast,\r\nWater falls as straight as her body rose,\r\nWater her brightness has from neck to still feet,\r\nWater crystal-cold as her cold body flows.\n\r\nBut not water has the colour I saw when I dreamed,\r\nNor water such strength has. I joyed to behold\r\nHow the blood lit her body with lamps of fire\r\nAnd made the flesh glow that like water gleamed cold.\n\r\nA flame in her arms and in each finger flame,\r\nAnd flame in her bosom, flame above, below,\r\nThe curve of climbing flame in her waist and her thighs;\r\nFrom foot to head did flame into red flame flow.\n\r\nI knew how beauty seen from unseen must rise,\r\nHow the body's joy for more than body's use was made.\r\nI knew then how the body is the body of the mind,\r\nAnd how the mind's own fire beneath the cool skin played.\n\r\nO shape that once to have seen is to see evermore,\r\nFalling stream that falls to the deeps of the mind,\r\nFire that once lit burns while aught burns in the world,\r\nFoot to head a flame moving in the spirit's wind!\n\r\nIf these eyes could see what these eyes have not seen--\r\nThe inward vision clear--how should I look for joy,\r\nKnowing that beauty's self rose visible in the world\r\nOver age that darkens, and griefs that destroy?\n",

They were right.'",
          "The moon gave no light.\r\nThe clouds rode slowly over, broad and white,\r\nFrom the soft south west.\r\nThe wind, that cannot rest,\r\nSoothed and then waked the darkness of the yew\r\nUntil the tree was restless too.\n\r\nOf all the winds I knew\r\nI thought, and how they muttered in the yew,\r\nOr raved under the eaves,\r\nOr nosed the fallen dry leaves,\r\nOr with harsh voice holloa'd the orchard round,\r\nWith snapped limbs littering the ground.\n\r\nAnd I thought how the yew\r\nBetween the window and the west his shadow threw,\r\nGrave and immense,\r\nDarkening the dark past thought and sense,\r\nAnd how the moon would make the darkness heavenly bright:\r\nBut the moon gave no light.",

and over there beyond\r\nThe guardian forest high, menacing and strange,\r\nInvades the empty sky with its wild black range.\n\r\nAnd they watch hour by hour that small lonely flower\r\nIn that deep forest place that hunter never found.\n\r\nIt shines without sound, as a star in space.\n\r\nAnd the silence all around that solitary place\r\nIs like silence in a dream; till a sudden flashing gleam\r\nDown their dark faces flies; and their lips fall apart\r\nAnd their glimmering great eyes with excitement dart\r\nAnd their fingers, clutching the branches they were touching,\r\nShake and arouse hissing leaves on the boughs.\n\r\nAnd they whisper aswoon: Did it move in the moon?\r\nO it moved as it grew!\r\nIt is moving, opening, with calm and gradual will,\r\nAnd their bodies where they cling are shadowed and still\r\nAnd with marvel they mark that the mud now is dark\r\nFor the unfolding flower, like a goddess in her power,\r\nChallenges the moon with a light of her own,\r\nThat lovelily grows as the petals unclose,\r\nWider, more wide with an awful inward pride,\r\nTill the heart of it breaks, and stilled is their breath,\r\nFor the radiance it makes is as wonderful as death.\n\r\nThe morning's crimson stain tinges their ashen brows\r\nAs they part the last boughs and slowly step again\r\nOn to the village grass, and chill and languid pass\r\nInto the huts to sleep.\r\nBrief slumber, yet so deep\r\nThat, when they wake to day, darkness and splendour seem\r\nBroken and far away, a faint miraculous dream;\r\nAnd when those maidens rise they are as they ever were\r\nSave only for a rare shade of trouble in their eyes.\r\nAnd the surly thick-lipped men, as they sit about their huts\r\nMaking drums out of guts, grunting gruffly now and then,\r\nCarving sticks of ivory, stretching shields of wrinkled skin,\r\nSmoothing sinister and thin squatting gods of ebony,\r\nChip and grunt and do not see.\r\nBut each mother, silently,\r\nLonger than her wont stays shut in the dimness of her hut,\r\nFor she feels a brooding cloud of memory in the air,\r\nA lingering thing there that makes her sit bowed\r\nWith hollow shining eyes, as the night-fire dies,\r\nAnd stare softly at the ember, and try to remember\r\nSomething sorrowful and far, something sweet and vaguely seen\r\nLike an early evening star when the sky is pale green:\r\nA quiet silver tower that climbed in an hour,\r\nOr a ghost like a flower, or a flower like a queen:\r\nSomething holy in the past that came and did not last.\n\r\nBut she knows not what it was.\n",

          " The rabbit in his burrow keeps\r\n No guarded watch, in peace he sleeps;\r\n The wolf that howls into the night\r\n Cowers to her lair at morning light;\r\n The simplest bird entwines a nest\r\n Where she may lean her lovely breast,\r\n Couched in the silence of the bough;\r\n But thou, O man, what rest hast thou?\n\r\n The deepest solitude can bring\r\n Only a subtler questioning\r\n In thy divided heart; thy bed\r\n Recalls at dawn what midnight said;\r\n Seek how thou wilt to feign content\r\n Thy flaming ardour's quickly spent;\r\n Soon thy last company is gone,\r\n And leaves thee - with thyself - alone.\n\r\n Pomp and great friends may hem thee round,\r\n A thousand busy tasks be found;\r\n Earth's thronging beauties may beguile\r\n Thy longing lovesick heart awhile;\r\n And pride, like clouds of sunset, spread\r\n A changing glory round thy head;\r\n But fade will all; and thou must come,\r\n Hating thy journey, homeless, home.\n\r\n Rave how thou wilt; unmoved, remote,\r\n That inward presence slumbers not,\r\n Frets out each secret from thy breast,\r\n Gives thee no rally, pause, nor rest,\r\n Scans close thy very thoughts, lest they\r\n Should sap his patient power away,\r\n Answers thy wrath with peace, thy cry\r\n With tenderest taciturnity.\n",
          "Wind-flicked and ruddy her young body glowed\r\nIn sunny shallows, splashing them to spray;\r\nBut when on rippled, silver sand she lay,\r\nAnd over her the little green waves flowed,\r\nColdly translucent and moon-coloured showed\r\nHer frail young beauty, as if rapt away\r\nFrom all the light and laughter of the day\r\nTo some twilit, forlorn sea-god's abode.\n\r\nAgain into the sun with happy cry\r\nShe leapt alive and sparkling from the sea,\r\nSprinkling white spray against the hot blue sky,\r\nA laughing girl ... and yet, I see her lie\r\nUnder a deeper tide eternally\r\nIn cold moon-coloured immortality.",
          " On the ragged edge of the world I'll roam,\r\n And the home of the wolf shall be my home,\r\n And a bunch of bones on the boundless snows\r\n The end of my trail . . . who knows, who knows!\n\r\nI'm dreaming to-night in the fire-glow, alone in my study tower,\r\nMy books battalioned around me, my Kipling flat on my knee;\r\nBut I'm not in the mood for reading, I haven't moved for an hour;\r\nBody and brain I'm weary, weary the heart of me;\r\nWeary of crushing a longing it's little I understand,\r\nFor I thought that my trail was ended, I thought I had earned my rest;\r\nBut oh, it's stronger than life is, the call of the hearthless land!\r\nAnd I turn to the North in my trouble, as a child to the mother-breast.\n\r\nHere in my den it's quiet; the sea-wind taps on the pane;\r\nThere's comfort and ease and plenty, the smile of the South is sweet.\r\nAll that a man might long for, fight for and seek in vain,\r\nPictures and books and music, pleasure my last retreat.\r\nPeace! I thought I had gained it, I swore that my tale was told;\r\nBy my hair that is grey I swore it, by my eyes that are slow to see;\r\nYet what does it all avail me? to-night, to-night as of old,\r\nOut of the dark I hear it - the Northland calling to me.\n\r\nAnd I'm daring a rampageous river that runs the devil knows where;\r\nMy hand is athrill on the paddle, the birch-bark bounds like a bird.\r\nHark to the rumble of rapids! Here in my morris chair\r\nEager and tense I'm straining - isn't it most absurd?\r\nNow in the churn and the lather, foam that hisses and stings,\r\nLeap I, keyed for the struggle, fury and fume and roar;\r\nRocks are spitting like hell-cats - Oh, it's a sport for kings,\r\nLife on a twist of the paddle . . . there's my \"Kim\" on the floor.\n\r\nHow I thrill and I vision! Then my camp of a night;\r\nRed and gold of the fire-glow, net afloat in the stream;\r\nScent of the pines and silence, little \"pal\" pipe alight,\r\nBody a-purr with pleasure, sleep untroubled of dream:\r\nBanquet of paystreak bacon! moment of joy divine,\r\nWhen the bannock is hot and gluey, and the teapot's nearing the boil!\r\nNever was wolf so hungry, stomach cleaving to spine. . . .\r\nHa! there's my servant calling, says that dinner will spoil.\n\r\nWhat do I want with dinner? Can I eat any more?\r\nCan I sleep as I used to? . . . Oh, I abhor this life!\r\nGive me the Great Uncertain, the Barren Land for a floor,\r\nThe Milky Way for a roof-beam, splendour and space and strife:\r\nSomething to fight and die for - the limpid Lake of the Bear,\r\nThe Empire of Empty Bellies, the dunes where the Dogribs dwell;\r\nBig things, real things, live things . . . here on my morris chair\r\nHow I ache for the Northland! \"Dinner and servants\" - Hell!!\n\r\nAm I too old, I wonder? Can I take one trip more?\r\nGo to the granite-ribbed valleys, flooded with sunset wine,\r\nPeaks that pierce the aurora, rivers I must explore,\r\nLakes of a thousand islands, millioning hordes of the Pine?\r\nDo they not miss me, I wonder, valley and peak and plain?\r\nWhispering each to the other: \"Many a moon has passed . . .\r\nWhere has he gone, our lover? Will he come back again?\r\nStar with his fires our tundra, leave us his bones at last?\"\n\r\nYes, I'll go back to the Northland, back to the way of the bear,\r\nBack to the muskeg and mountain, back to the ice-leaguered sea.\r\nOld am I! what does it matter? Nothing I would not dare;\r\nGive me a trail to conquer - Oh, it is \"meat\" to me!\r\nI will go back to the Northland, feeble and blind and lame;\r\nSup with the sunny-eyed Husky, eat moose-nose with the Cree;\r\nPlay with the Yellow-knife bastards, boasting my blood and my name:\r\nI will go back to the Northland, for the Northland is calling to me.\n\r\nThen give to me paddle and whiplash, and give to me tumpline and gun;\r\nGive to me salt and tobacco, flour and a gunny of tea;\r\nTake me up over the Circle, under the flamboyant sun;\r\nTurn me foot-loose like a savage - that is the finish of me.\r\nI know the trail I am seeking, it's up by the Lake of the Bear;\r\nIt's down by the Arctic Barrens, it's over to Hudson's Bay;\r\nMaybe I'll get there, - maybe: death is set by a hair. . . .\r\nHark! it's the Northland calling! now must I go away. . . .\n\r\n Go to the Wild that waits for me;\r\n Go where the moose and the musk-ox be;\r\n Go to the wolf and the secret snows;\r\n Go to my fate . . . who knows, who knows!",

          "That Barret, the painter of pictures, what feeling for color he had!\r\nAnd Fanning, the maker of music, such melodies mirthful and mad!\r\nAnd Harley, the writer of stories, so whimsical, tender and glad!\n\r\nTo hark to their talk in the trenches, high heart unfolding to heart,\r\nOf the day when the war would be over, and each would be true to his part,\r\nUpbuilding a Palace of Beauty to the wonder and glory of Art . . .\n\r\nYon's Barret, the painter of pictures, yon carcass that rots on the wire;\r\nHis hand with its sensitive cunning is crisped to a cinder with fire;\r\nHis eyes with their magical vision are bubbles of glutinous mire.\n\r\nPoor Fanning! He sought to discover the symphonic note of a shell;\r\nThere are bits of him broken and bloody, to show you the place where he fell;\r\nI've reason to fear on his exquisite ear the rats have been banqueting well.\n\r\nAnd speaking of Harley, the writer, I fancy I looked on him last,\r\nSprawling and staring and writhing in the roar of the battle blast;\r\nThen a mad gun-team crashed over, and scattered his brains as it passed.\n\r\nOh, Harley and Fanning and Barret, they were bloody good mates o' mine;\r\nTheir bodies are empty bottles; Death has guzzled the wine;\r\nWhat's left of them's filth and corruption. . . . Where is the Fire Divine?\n\r\nI'll tell you. . . . At night in the trenches, as I watch and I do my part,\r\nThree radiant spirits I'm seeing, high heart revealing to heart,\r\nAnd they're building a peerless palace to the splendor and triumph of Art.\n\r\nYet, alas! for the fame of Barret, the glory he might have trailed!\r\nAnd alas! for the name of Fanning, a star that beaconed and paled,\r\nPoor Harley, obscure and forgotten. . . . Well, who shall say that they failed!\n\r\nNo, each did a Something Grander than ever he dreamed to do;\r\nAnd as for the work unfinished, all will be paid their due;\r\nThe broken ends will be fitted, the balance struck will be true.\n\r\nSo painters, and players, and penmen, I tell you: Do as you please;\r\nLet your fame outleap on the trumpets, you'll never rise up to these - \r\nTo three grim and gory Tommies, down, down on your bended knees!",
          "On old Cold Crendon's windy tops\r\nGrows wintrily Blown Hilcote Copse,\r\nWind-bitten beech with badger barrows,\r\nWhere brocks eat wasp-grubs with their marrows,\r\nAnd foxes lie on short-grassed turf,\r\nNose between paws, to hear the surf\r\nOf wind in the beeches drowsily.\r\nThere was our fox bred lustily\r\nThree years before, and there he berthed,\r\nUnder the beech-roots snugly earthed,\r\nWith a roof of flint and a floor of chalk\r\nAnd ten bitten hens' heads each on its stalk,\r\nSome rabbits' paws, some fur from scuts,\r\nA badger's corpse and a smell of guts.\r\nAnd there on the night before my tale\r\nHe trotted out for a point in the vale.\n\r\nHe saw, from the cover edge, the valley\r\nGo trooping down with its droops of sally\r\nTo the brimming river's lipping bend,\r\nAnd a light in the inn at Water's End.\r\nHe heard the owl go hunting by\r\nAnd the shriek of the mouse the owl made die,\r\nAnd the purr of the owl as he tore the red\r\nStrings from between his claws and fed;\r\nThe smack of joy of the horny lips\r\nMarbled green with the blob by strips.\r\nHe saw the farms where the dogs were barking,\r\nCold Crendon Court and Copsecote Larking;\r\nThe fault with the spring as bright as gleed,\r\nGreen-slash-laced with water-weed.\r\nA glare in the sky still marked the town,\r\nThough all folk slept and the blinds were down,\r\nThe street lamps watched the empty square,\r\nThe night-cat sang his evil there.\n\r\nThe fox's nose tipped up and round,\r\nSince smell is a part of sight and sound.\r\nDelicate smells were drifting by,\r\nThe sharp nose flaired them heedfully;\r\nPartridges in the clover stubble,\r\nCrouched in a ring for the stoat to nubble.\r\nRabbit bucks beginning to box;\r\nA scratching place for the pheasant cock\r\nA hare in the dead grass near the drain,\r\nAnd another smell like the spring again.\n\r\nA faint rank taint like April coming,\r\nIt cocked his ears and his blood went drumming,\r\nFor somewhere out by Ghost Heath Stubs\r\nWas a roving vixen wanting cubs.\r\nOver the valley, floating faint\r\nOn a warmth of windflaw, came the taint;\r\nHe cocked his ears, he' upped his brush,\r\nAnd he went upwind like an April thrush\n\r\nBy the Roman Road to Braiches Ridge,\r\nWhere the fallen willow makes a bridge,\r\nOver the brook by White Hart's Thorn\r\nTo the acres thin with pricking corn,\r\nOver the sparse green hair of the wheat,\r\nBy the Clench Brook Mill at Clench Brook Leat,\r\nThrough Cowfoot Pastures to Nonely Stevens,\r\nAnd away to Poltrewood St. Jevons.\r\nPast Tott Hill Down all snaked with meuses,\r\nPast Clench St. Michael and Naunton Crucis,\r\nPast Howle's Oak Farm where the raving brain\r\nOf a dog who heard him foamed his chain;\r\nThen off, as the farmer's window opened,\r\nPast Stonepits Farm to Upton Hope End,\r\nOver short sweet grass and worn flint arrows\r\nAnd the three dumb hows of Tencombe Barrows.\r\nAnd away and away with a rolling scramble,\r\nThrough the sally and up the bramble,\r\nWith a nose for the smells the night wind carried,\r\nAnd his red fell clean for being married;\r\nFor clicketting time and Ghost Heath Wood\r\nHad put the violet in his blood.\n\r\nAt Tencombe Rings near the Manor Linney\r\nHis foot made the great black stallion whinny,\r\nAnd the stallion's whinny aroused the stable\r\nAnd the bloodhound bitches stretched their cable,\r\nAnd the clink of the bloodhounds' chain aroused\r\nThe sweet-breathed kye as they chewed and drowsed,\r\nAnd the stir of the cattle changed the dream\r\nOf the cat in the loft to tense green gleam.\r\nThe red-wattled black cock hot from Spain\r\nCrowed from his perch for dawn again,\r\nHis breast-pufft hens, one-legged on perch,\r\nGurgled, beak-down, like men in church,\r\nThey crooned in the dark, lifting one red eye\r\nIn the raftered roost as the fox went by.\n\r\nBy Tencombe Regis and Slaughters Court,\r\nThrough the great grass square of Roman Fort,\r\nBy Nun's Wood Yews and the Hungry Hill,\r\nAnd the Corpse Way Stones all standing still.\r\nBy Seven Springs Mead to Deerlip Brook,\r\nAnd a lolloping leap to Water Hook.\r\nThen with eyes like sparks and his blood awoken,\r\nOver the grass to Water's Oaken,\r\nAnd over the hedge and into the ride\r\nIn Ghost Heath Wood for his roving bride.\n\r\nBefore the dawn he had loved and fed,\r\nAnd found a kennel, and gone to bed\r\nOn a shelf of grass in a thick of gorse\r\nThat would bleed a hound and blind a horse.\r\nThere he slept in the mild west weather\r\nWith his nose and brush well tuckt together,\r\nHe slept like a child, who sleeps yet hears\r\nWith the self who needs neither eyes nor ears.\n\r\nHe slept while the pheasant cock untucked\r\nHis head from his wing, flew down and kukked,\r\nWhile the drove of the starlings whirred and wheeled\r\nOut of the ash-trees into field,\r\nWhile with great black flags that flogged and paddled\r\nThe rooks went out to the plough and straddled,\r\nStraddled wide on the moist red cheese\r\nOf the furrows driven at Uppat's Leas.\n\r\nDown in the village men awoke,\r\nThe chimneys breathed with a faint blue smoke;\r\nThe fox slept on, though tweaks and twitches,\r\nDue to his dreams, ran down his flitches.\n\r\nThe cows were milked and the yards were sluict,\r\nAnd the cocks and hens let out of roost,\r\nWindows were opened, mats were beaten,\r\nAll men's breakfasts were cooked and eaten;\r\nBut out in the gorse on the grassy shelf\r\nThe sleeping fox looked after himself.\n\r\nDeep in his dream he heard the life\r\nOf the woodland seek for food or wife,\r\nThe hop of a stoat, a buck that thumped\r\nThe squeal of a rat as a weasel jumped,\r\nThe blackbird's chackering scattering crying,\r\nThe rustling bents from the rabbits flying,\r\nCows in a byre, and distant men,\r\nAnd Condicote church-clock striking ten.\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock a boy went past,\r\nWith a rough-haired terrier following fast.\r\nThe boy's sweet whistle and dog's quick yap\r\nWoke the fox from out of his nap.\n\r\nHe rose and stretched till the claws in his pads\r\nStuck hornily out like long black gads.\r\nHe listened a while, and his nose went round\r\nTo catch the smell of the distant sound.\n\r\nThe windward smells came free from taint\r\nThey were rabbit, strongly, with lime-kiln, faint,\r\nA wild-duck, likely, at Sars Holt Pond,\r\nAnd sheep on the Sars Holt Down beyond.\n\r\nThe leeward smells were much less certain,\r\nFor the Ghost Heath Hill was like a curtain,\r\nYet vague, from the leeward, now and then,\r\nCame muffled sounds like the sound of men.\n\r\nHe moved to his right to a clearer space,\r\nAnd all his soul came into his face,\r\nInto his eyes and into his nose,\r\nAs over the hill a murmur rose.\r\nHis ears were cocked and his keen nose flaired,\r\nHe sneered with his lips till his teeth were bared,\r\nHe trotted right and lifted a pad,\r\nTrying to test what foes he had.\n\r\nOn Ghost Heath turf was a steady drumming\r\nWhich sounded like horses quickly coming,\r\nIt died as the hunt went down the dip,\r\nThen Malapert yelped at Myngs's whip.\r\nA bright iron horseshoe clinkt on stone,\r\nThen a man's voice spoke, not one alone,\r\nThen a burst of laughter, swiftly still,\r\nMuffled away by Ghost Heath Hill.\r\nThen, indistinctly, the clop, clip, clep,\r\nOn Brady Ride, of a horse's step.\r\nThen silence, then, in a burst, much clearer,\r\nVoices and horses coming nearer,\r\nAnd another noise, of a pit-pat beat\r\nOn the Ghost Hill grass, of foxhound feet.\n\r\nHe sat on his haunches listening hard,\r\nWhile his mind went over the compass card.\r\nMen were coming and rest was done,\r\nBut he still had time to get fit to run;\r\nHe could outlast horse and outrace hound,\r\nBut men were devils from Lobs's Pound.\r\nScent was burning, the going good,\r\nThe world one lust for a fox's blood,\r\nThe main earths stopped and the drains put to,\r\nAnd fifteen miles to the land he knew.\r\nBut of all the ills, the ill least pleasant\r\nWas to run in the light when men were present.\r\nMen in the fields to shout and sign\r\nFor a lift of hounds to a fox's line.\r\nMen at the earth, at the long point's end,\r\nMen at each check and none his friend,\r\nGuessing each shift that a fox contrives;\r\nBut still, needs must when the devil drives. .\n\r\nHe readied himself, then a soft horn blew,\r\nThen a clear voice carolled, \"Ed-hoick! Eleu!\"\r\nThen the wood-end rang with the clear voice crying\r\nAnd the crackle of scrub where hounds were trying.\r\nThen the horn blew nearer, a hound's voice quivered,\r\nThen another, then more, till his body shivered,\r\nHe left his kennel and trotted thence\r\nWith his ears flexed back and his nerves all tense.\r\nHe trotted down with his nose intent\r\nFor a fox's line to cross his scent,\r\nIt was only fair (he being a stranger)\r\nThat the native fox should have the danger.\r\nDanger was coming! so swift, so swift,\r\nThat the pace of his trot began to lift.\r\nThe blue-winged Judas, a jay began\r\nSwearing, hounds whimpered, air stank of man.\n\r\nHe hurried his trotting, he now felt frighted,\r\nIt was his poor body made hounds excited.\r\nHe felt as he ringed the great wood through\r\nThat he ought to make for the land he knew.\n\r\nThen the hounds' excitement quivered and quickened,\r\nThen a horn blew death till his marrow sickened,\r\nThen the wood behind was a crash of cry\r\nFor the blood in his veins; it made him fly.\n\r\nThey were on his line; it was death to stay.\r\nHe must make for home by the shortest way,\r\nBut with all this yelling and all this wrath\r\nAnd all these devils, how find a path?\n\r\nHe ran like a stag to the wood's north corner,\r\nWhere the hedge was thick and the ditch a yawner,\r\nBut the scarlet glimpse of Myngs on Turk,\r\nWatching the woodside, made him shirk.\n\r\nHe ringed the wood and looked at the south.\r\nWhat wind there was blew into his mouth.\r\nBut close to the woodland's blackthorn thicket\r\nWas Dansey, still as a stone, on picket.\r\nAt Dansey's back were a twenty more\r\nWatching the cover and pressing fore.\n\r\nThe fox drew in and flaired with his muzzle.\r\nDeath was there if he messed the puzzle.\r\nThere were men without and hounds within,\r\nA crying that stiffened the hair on skin,\r\nTeeth in cover and death without,\r\nBoth deaths coming, and no way out.\n\r\nHis nose ranged swjftly, his heart beat fast,\r\nThen a crashing cry rose up in a blast,\r\nThen horsehooves trampled, then horses' flitches\r\nBurst their way through the hazel switches.\r\nThen the horn again made the hounds like mad,\r\nAnd a man, quite near, said, \"Found, by Gad!\"\r\nAnd a man, quite near, said, \"Now he'll break.\r\nLarks Ley bourne Copse is the line he'll take.\"\r\nAnd men moved up with their talk and stink\r\nAnd the traplike noise of the horseshoe clink.\r\nMen whose coming meant death from teeth\r\nIn a worrying wrench, with him beneath.\n\r\nThe fox sneaked down by the cover side\r\n(With his ears flexed back) as a snake would glide;\r\nHe took the ditch at the cover-end,\r\nHe hugged the ditch as his only friend.\r\nThe blackbird cock with the golden beak\r\nGot out of his way with a jabbering shriek,\r\nAnd the shriek told Tom on the raking bay\r\nThat for eighteen pence he was gone away.\n\r\nHe ran in the hedge in the triple growth\r\nOf bramble and hawthorn, glad of both,\r\nTill a couple of fields were past, and then\r\nCame the living death of the dread of men.\n\r\nThen, as he listened, he heard a \"Hoy!\"\r\nTom Danser's horn and \"A wa-wa-woy!\"\r\nThen all hounds crying with all their forces,\r\nThen a thundering down of seventy horses.\r\nRobin Dawe's horn and halloos of \" Hey,\r\nHark Hollar, Hoik!\"and\" Gone away!\"\r\n\"Hark Hollar, Hoik!\"and a smack of the whip\"\r\nA yelp as a tail hound caught the clip.\r\n\"Hark Hollar, Hark Hollar!\" then Robin made\r\nPip go crash through the cut and laid.\r\nHounds were over and on his line\r\nWith a head like bees upon Tipple Tine.\r\nThe sound of the nearness sent a flood\r\nOf terror of death through the fox's blood.\r\nHe upped his brush and he cocked his nose,\r\nAnd he went upwind as a racer goes.\n\r\nBold Robin Dawe was over first,\r\nCheering his hounds on at the burst;\r\nThe field were spurring to be in it.\r\n\"Hold hard, sirs, give them half a minute,\"\r\nCame from Sir Peter on his white.\r\nThe hounds went romping with delight\r\nOver the grass and got together,\r\nThe tail hounds galloped hell-for-leather\r\nAfter the pack at Myngs's yell.\r\nA cry like every kind of bell\r\nRang from these rompers as they raced.\n\r\nThe riders, thrusting to be placed,\r\nJammed down their hats and shook their horses;\r\nThe hounds romped past with all their forces,\r\nThey crashed into the blackthorn fence.\r\nThe scent was heavy on their sense,\r\nSo hot, it seemed the living thing,\r\nIt made the blood within them sing;\r\nGusts of it made their hackles rise,\r\nHot gulps of it were agonies\r\nOf joy, and thirst for blood and passion.\r\n\"Forrard!\" cried Robin, \" that's the fashion.\"\r\nHe raced beside his pack to cheer.\r\nThe field's noise died upon his ear,\r\nA faint horn, far behind, blew thin\r\nIn cover, lest some hound were in.\r\nThen instantly the great grass rise\r\nShut field and cover from his eyes,\r\nHe and his racers were alone.\r\n\"A dead fox or a broken bone,\"\r\nSaid Robin, peering for his prey.\n\r\nThe rise, which shut the field away,\r\nShowed him the vale's great map spread out,\r\nThe down's lean flank and thrusting snout,\r\nPale pastures, red-brown plough, dark wood,\r\nBlue distance, still as solitude,\r\nGlitter of water here and there,\r\nThe trees so delicately bare,\r\nThe dark green gorse and bright green holly.\r\n\"0 glorious God,\" he said, \"how jolly!'\r\nAnd there downhill two fields ahead\r\nThe lolloping red dog-fox sped\r\nOver Poor Pastures to the brook.\r\nHe grasped these things in one swift look,\r\nThen dived into the bullfinch heart\r\nThrough thorns that ripped his sleeves apart\r\nAnd skutched new blood upon his brow.\r\n\"His point's Lark's Leybourne Covers now,\r\n\"Said Robin, landing with a grunt.\r\n\"Forrard, my beautifuls!\"\r\nThe hunt\r\nFollowed downhill to race with him,\r\nWhite Rabbit, with his swallow's skim,\r\nDrew within hail. \"Quick burst, Sir Peter,\"\r\n\"A traveller. Nothing could be neater.\r\nMaking for Godsdown Clumps, I take it?\"\r\n\"Lark's Leybourne, sir, if he can make it.\r\nForrard!\"\r\nBill Ridden thundered down,\r\nHis big mouth grinned beneath his frown,\r\nThe hounds were going away from horses.\r\nHe saw the glint of watercourses,\r\nYell Brook and Wittold's Dyke, ahead,\r\nHis horseshoes sliced the green turf red.\r\nYoung Cothill's chaser rushed and past him,\r\nNob Manor, running next, said \" Blast him!\r\nThe poet chap who thinks he rides.\"\r\nHugh Colway's mare made straking strides\r\nAcross the grass, the Colonel next,\r\nThen Squire, volleying oaths, and vext,\r\nFighting his hunter for refusing;\r\nBell Ridden, like a cutter cruising,\r\nSailing the grass; then Cob on Warder;\r\nThen Minton Price upon Marauder;\r\nOck Gurney with his eyes intense,\r\nBurning as with a different sense,\r\nHis big mouth muttering glad \"By damns!\"\r\nThen Pete, crouched down from head to hams,\r\nRapt like a saint, bright focussed flame;\r\nBennett, with devils in his wame,\r\nChewing black cud and spitting slanting;\r\nCopse scattering jests and Stukely ranting;\r\nSal Ridden taking line from Dansey;\r\n(Long Robert forcing Necromancy;\r\nA dozen more with bad beginnings;\r\nMyngs riding hard to snatch an innings.\r\nA wild last hound with high shrill yelps\r\nSmacked forrard with some whipthong skelps.\r\nThen last of all, at top of rise,\r\nThe crowd on foot, all gasps and eyes;\r\nThe run up hill had winded them.\n\r\nThey saw the Yell Brook like a gem\r\nBlue in the grass a short mile on;\r\nThey heard faint cries, but hounds were gone\r\nA good eight fields and out of sight,\r\nExcept a rippled glimmer white\r\nGoing away with dying cheering,\r\nAnd scarlet flappings disappearing,\r\nAnd scattering horses going, going,\r\nGoing like mad, White Rabbit snowing\r\nFar on ahead, a loose horse taking\r\nFence after fence with stirrups shaking,\r\nAnd scarlet specks and dark specks dwindling.\n\r\nNearer, were twigs knocked into kindling,\r\nA much-bashed fence still dropping stick,\r\nFlung clods still quivering from the kick;\r\nCut hoof-marks pale in cheesy clay,\r\nThe horse-smell blowing clean away;\r\nBirds flitting back into the cover.\r\nOne last faint cry, then all was over.\r\nThe hunt had been, and found, and gone.\n\r\nAt Neaking's Farm three furlongs on,\r\nHounds raced across the Waysmore Road,\r\nWhere many of the riders slowed\r\nTo tittup down a grassy lane\r\nWhich led as hounds led in the main,\r\nAnd gave no danger of a fall.\r\nThere as they tittupped one and all,\r\nBig Twenty Stone came scattering by,\r\nHis great mare made the hoof-casts fly.\r\n\"By leave!\" he cried. \"Come on!

The line he took\r\nWas Tineton and the Pantry Brook,\r\nGoing like fun and hounds like mad.\r\nTom glanced to see what friends he had\r\nStill within sight, before he turned\r\nThe ridge's shoulder; he discerned,\r\nOne field away, young Cothill sailing\r\nEasily up. Pete Gurney failing,\r\nHugh Colway quartering on Sir Peter,\r\nBill waiting on the mare to beat her,\r\nSal Ridden skirting to the right.\r\nA horse, with stirrups flashing bright\r\nOver his head at every stride,\r\nLooked like the Major's; Tom espied\r\nFar back a scarlet speck of man\r\nRunning, and straddling as he ran.\r\nCharles Copse was up, Nob Manor followed,\r\nThen Bennett's big-boned black that wallowed,\r\nClumsy, but with the strength of ten.\r\nThen black and brown and scarlet men,\r\nBrown horses, white and black and grey,\r\nScattered a dozen fields away.\r\nThe shoulder shut the scene away.\n\r\nFrom the Gallows Hill to the Tineton Copse\r\nThere were ten ploughed fields, like ten full-stops,\r\nAll wet red clay, where a horse's foot\r\nWould be swathed, feet thick, like an ash-tree root.\r\nThe fox raced on, on the headlands firm,\r\nWhere his swift feet scared the coupling worm;\r\nThe rooks rose raving to curse him raw,\r\nHe snarled a sneer at their swoop and caw.\r\nThen on, then on, down a half-ploughed field\r\nWhere a ship-like plough drove glitter-keeled,\r\nWith a bay horse near and a white horse leading,\r\nAnd a man saying \"Zook,\" and the red earth bleeding.\r\nHe gasped as he saw the ploughman drop\r\nThe stilts and swear at the team to stop.\r\nThe plough man ran in his red clay clogs,\r\nCrying, \"Zick un, Towzer; zick, good dogs!\"\r\nA couple of wire-haired lurchers lean\r\nArose from his wallet, nosing keen;\r\nWith a rushing swoop they were on his track,\r\nPutting chest to stubble to bite his back.\r\nHe swerved from his line with the curs at heel,\r\nThe teeth as they missed him clicked like steel.\r\nWith a worrying snarl, they quartered on him,\r\nWhile the ploughman shouted, \"Zick; upon him.\"\n\r\nThe lurcher dogs soon shot their bolt,\r\nAnd the fox raced on by the Hazel Holt,\r\nDown the dead grass tilt to the sandstone gash\r\nOf the Pantry Brook at Tineton Ash.\r\nThe loitering water, flooded full,\r\nHad yeast on its lip like raddled wool,\r\nIt was wrinkled over with Arab script\r\nOf eddies that twisted up and slipt.\r\nThe stepping-stones had a rush about them,\r\nSo the fox plunged in and swam without them.\n\r\nHe crossed to the cattle's drinking shallow,\r\nFirmed up with rush and the roots of mallow;\r\nHe wrung his coat from his draggled bones\r\nAnd romped away for the Sarsen Stones.\n\r\nA sneaking glance with his ears flexed back\r\nMade sure that his scent had failed the pack,\r\nFor the red clay, good for corn and roses,\r\nWas cold for scent and brought hounds to noses.\n\r\nHe slackened pace by the Tineton Tree\r\n(A vast hollow ash-tree grown in three),\r\nHe wriggled a shake and padded slow,\r\nNot sure if the hounds were on or no.\n\r\nA horn blew faint, then he heard the sounds\r\nOf a cantering huntsman; lifting hounds;\r\nThe ploughman had raised his hat for sign,\r\nAnd the hounds were lifted and on his line.\r\nHe heard the splash in the Pantry Brook,\r\nAnd a man's voice: \"Thiccy's the line he took.\"\r\nAnd a clear \"Yoi doit!\" and a whimpering quaver,\r\nThough the lurcher dogs had dulled the savour.\n\r\nThe fox went off while the hounds made halt,\r\nAnd the horses breathed and the field found fault,\r\nBut the whimpering rose to a crying crash\r\nBy the hollow ruin of Tineton Ash.\r\nThen again the kettledrum horsehooves beat,\r\nAnd the green blades bent to the fox's feet,\r\nAnd the cry rose keen not far behind\r\nOf the \" Blood, blood, blood,\" in the foxhounds' mind.\n\r\nThe fox was strong, he was full of running,\r\nHe could run for an hour and then be cunning,\r\nBut the cry behind him made him chill,\r\nThey were nearer now and they meant to kill.\r\nThey meant to run him until his blood\r\nClogged on his heart as his brush with mud,\r\nTill his back bent up and his tongue hung flagging,\r\nAnd his belly and brush were filthed from dragging;\r\nTill he crouched stone-still, dead-beat and dirty,\r\nWith nothing but teeth against the thirty.\r\nAnd all the way to that blinding end\r\nHe would meet with men and have none his friend:\r\nMen to holloa and men to run him,\r\nWith stones to stagger and yells to stun him;\r\nMen to head him, with whips to beat him,\r\nTeeth to mangle and mouths to eat him.\r\nAnd all the way, that wild high crying,\r\nTo cold his blood with the thought of dying,\r\nThe horn and the cheer, and the drum-like thunder\r\nOf the horsehooves stamping the meadows under.\r\nHe upped his brush and went with a will\r\nFor the Sarsen Stones on Wan Dyke Hill.\n\r\nAs he ran the meadow by Tineton Church\r\nA christening party left the porch;\r\nThey stood stock still as he pounded by,\r\nThey wished him luck but they thought he'd die.\r\nThe toothless babe in his long white coat\r\nLooked delicate meat, the fox took note;\r\nBut the sight of them grinning there, pointing finger,\r\nMade him put on steam till he went a stinger.\n\r\nPast Tineton Church, over Tineton Waste,\r\nWith the lolloping ease of a fox's haste,\r\nThe fur on his chest blown dry with the air,\r\nHis brush still up and his cheek-teeth bare.\r\nOver the Waste, where the ganders grazed,\r\nThe long swift lilt of his loping lazed,\r\nHis ears cocked up as his blood ran higher,\r\nHe saw his point, and his eyes took fire.\r\nThe Wan Dyke Hill with its fir-tree barren,\r\nIts dark of gorse and its rabbit-warren,\r\nThe Dyke on its heave like a tightened girth,\r\nAnd holes in the Dyke where a fox might earth.\r\nHe had rabbited there long months before,\r\nThe earths were deep and his need was sore;\r\nThe way was new, but he took a bearing,\r\nAnd rushed like a blown ship billow-sharing.\n\r\nOff Tineton Common to Tineton Dean,\r\nWhere the wind-hid elders pushed with green;\r\nThrough the Dean's thin cover across the lane,\r\nAnd up Midwinter to King of Spain.\r\nOld Joe, at digging his garden grounds,\r\nSaid: \"A fox, being hunted;

The fox come past\r\n(As I was digging) as fast as fast.\r\nHe's only been gone a minute by;\r\nA girt dark dog as pert as pye.\"\r\nEllen and Susan came out scattering\r\nBrooms and dustpans till all was clattering;\r\nThey saw the pack come head-to-foot\r\nRunning like racers, nearly mute;\r\nRobin and Dansey quartering near,\r\nAll going gallop like startled deer.\r\nA half-dozen flitting scarlets showing\r\nIn the thin green Dean where the pines were growing.\r\nBlackcoats and browncoats thrusting and spurring,\r\nSending the partridge coveys whirring.\r\nThen a rattle uphill and a clop up lane,\r\nIt emptied the bar of the King of Spain.\n\r\nTom left his cider, Dick left his bitter,\r\nGranfer James left his pipe and spitter;\r\nOut they came from the sawdust floor.\r\nThey said, \"They'm going.\"They said, \"0 Lor'!\"\r\nThe fox raced on, up the Barton Balks,\r\nWith a crackle of kex in the nettle stalks,\r\nOver Hammond's grass to the dark green line\r\nOf the larch-wood smelling of turpentine.\r\nScratch Steven Larches, black to the sky,\r\nA sadness breathing with one long sigh,\r\nGrey ghosts of trees under funeral plumes,\r\nA mist of twig over soft brown glooms.\r\nAs he entered the wood he heard the smacks,\r\nChip-jar, of the fir-pole feller's axe.\r\nHe swerved to the left to a broad green ride,\r\nWhere a boy made him rush for the farther side.\r\nHe swerved to the left, to the Barton Road,\r\nBut there were the timberers come to load\r\nTwo timber-carts and a couple of carters\r\nWith straps round their knees instead of garters.\r\nHe swerved to the right, straight down the wood,\r\nThe carters watched him, the boy hallooed.\r\nHe leaped from the larch-wood into tillage,\r\nThe cobbler's garden of Barton village.\n\r\nThe cobbler bent at his wooden foot,\r\nBeating sprigs in a broken boot;\r\nHe wore old glasses with thick horn rim,\r\nHe scowled at his work, for his sight was dim.\r\nHis face was dingy, his lips were grey,\r\nFrom primming sparrowbills day by day.\r\nAs he turned his boot he heard a noise\r\nAt his garden-end, and he thought, \"It's boys.\"\n\r\nHe saw his cat nip up on the shed,\r\nWhere her back arched up till it touched her head;\r\nHe saw his rabbit race round and round\r\nIts little black box three feet from ground.\r\nHis six hens cluckered and flocked to perch,\r\n\"That's boys,\" said cobbler,\"so I'll go search.\"\r\nHe reached his stick and blinked in his wrath,\r\nWhen he saw 'a fox in his garden path.\n\r\nThe fox swerved left and scrambled out,\r\nKnocking crinked green shells from the brussels-sprout,\r\nHe scrambled out through the cobbler's paling,\r\nAnd up Pill's orchard to Purton's Tailing,\r\nAcross the plough at the top of bent,\r\nThrough the heaped manure to kill his scent,\r\nOver to Aldam's, up to Cappell's.\r\nPast Nursery Lot with its whitewashed apples,\r\nPast Colston's Broom, past Gaunt's, past Shere's,\r\nPast Foxwhelps' Oasts with their hooded ears,\r\nPast Monk's Ash Clerewell, past Beggars' Oak,\r\nPast the great elms blue with the Hinton smoke.\r\nAlong Long Hinton to Hinton Green,\r\nWhere the wind-washed steeple stood serene\r\nWith its golden bird still sailing air.\r\nPast Banner Barton, past Chipping Bare,\r\nPast Madding's Hollow, down Dundry Dip,\r\nAnd up Goose Grass to the Sailing Ship.\n\r\nThe three black firs of the Ship stood still\r\nOn the bare chalk heave of the Dundry Hill.\r\nThe fox looked back as he slackened past\r\nThe scaled red-bole of the mizen-mast.\n\r\nThere they were coming, mute but swift\r\nA scarlet smear in the blackthorn rift,\r\nA white horse rising, a dark horse flying,\r\nAnd the, hungry hounds too tense for crying.\r\nStormcock leading, his stern spear straight,\r\nRacing as though for a piece of plate,\r\nLittle speck horsemen field on field;\r\nThen Dansey viewed him and Robin squealed.\n\r\nAt the \"View Halloo!\" the hounds went frantic:\r\nBack went Stormcock and up went Antic,\r\nUp went Skylark as Antic sped,\r\nIt was zest to blood how they carried head.\r\nSkylark drooped as Maroon drew by,\r\nTheir hackles lifted, they scored to cry.\n\r\nThe fox knew well that, before they tore him,\r\nThey should try their speed on the downs before him.\r\nThere were three more miles to the Wan Dyke Hill,\r\nBut his heart was high that he beat them still.\r\nThe wind of the downland charmed his bones,\r\nSo off he went for the Sarsen Stones.\n\r\nThe moan of the three great firs in the wind\r\nAnd the \"Ai \" of the foxhounds died behind;\r\nWind-dapples followed the hill-wind's breath\r\nOn the Kill Down Gorge where the Danes found death.\r\nLarks scattered up; the peewits feeding\r\nRose in a flock from the Kill Down Steeding.\r\nThe hare leaped up from her form and swerved\r\nSwift left for the Starveall, harebell-turved.\r\nOn the wind-bare thorn some longtails prinking\r\nCried sweet as though wind-blown glass were chinking.\r\nBehind came thudding and loud halloo,\r\nOr a cry from hounds as they came to view.\n\r\nThe pure clean air came sweet to his lungs,\r\nTill he thought foul scorn of those crying tongues.\r\nIn a three mile more he would reach the haven\r\nIn the Wan Dyke croaked on by the raven.\r\nIn a three mile more he would make his berth\r\nOn the hard cool floor of a Wan Dyke earth,\r\nToo deep for spade, too curved for terrier,\r\nWith the pride of the race to make rest the merrier.\r\nIn a three mile more he would reach his dream,\r\nSo his game heart gulped and he put on steam.\n\r\nLike a rocket shot to a ship ashore\r\nThe lean red bolt of his body tore,\r\nLike a ripple of wind running swift on grass;\r\nLike a shadow on wheat when a cloud blows past,\r\nLike a turn at the buoy in a cutter sailing\r\nWhen the bright green gleam lips white at the railing,\r\nLike the April snake whipping back to sheath,\r\nLike the gannets' hurtle on fish beneath,\r\nLike a kestrel chasing, like a sickle reaping,\r\nLike all things swooping, like all things sweeping,\r\nLike a hound for stay, like a stag for swift,\r\nWith his shadow beside like spinning drift.\n\r\nPast the gibbet-stock all stuck with nails,\r\nWhere they hanged in chains what had hung at jails,\r\nPast Ashmundshowe where Ashmund sleeps,\r\nAnd none but the tumbling peewit weeps,\r\nPast Curlew Calling, the gaunt grey corner\r\nWhere the curlew comes as a summer mourner,\r\nPast Blowbury Beacon, shaking his fleece,\r\nWhere all winds hurry and none brings peace;\r\nThen down on the mile-long green decline,\r\nWhere the turf's like spring and the air's like wine,\r\nWhere the sweeping spurs of the downland spill\r\nInto Wan Brook Valley and Wan Dyke Hill.\n\r\nOn he went with a galloping rally\r\nPast Maesbury Clump for Wan Brook Valley.\r\nThe blood in his veins went romping high,\r\n\"Get on, on, on, to the earth or die.\"\r\nThe air of the downs went purely past .\r\nTill he felt the glory of going fast,\r\nTill the terror of death, though there indeed,\r\nWas lulled for a while by his pride of speed. '\"\r\nHe was romping away from hounds and hunt,\r\nHe had Wan Dyke Hill and his earth in front,\r\nIn a one mile more when his point was made\r\nHe would rest in safety from dog or spade;\r\nNose between paws he would hear the shout\r\nOf the \"Gone to earth!\" to the hounds without,\r\nThe whine of the hounds, and their cat-feet gadding,\r\nScratching the earth, and their breath pad-padding;\r\nHe would hear the horn call hounds away,\r\nAnd rest in peace till another day.\n\r\nIn one mile more he would lie at rest,\r\nSo for one mile more he would go his best.\r\nHe reached the dip at the long droop's end\r\nAnd he took what speed he had still to spend.\r\nSo down past Maesbury beech-clump grey\r\nThat would not be green till the end of May,\r\nPast Arthur's Table, the white chalk boulder,\r\nWhere pasque flowers purple the down's grey shoulder,\r\nPast Quichelm's Keeping, past Harry's Thorn,\r\nTo Thirty Acre all thin with corn.\n\r\nAs he raced the corn towards Wan Dyke Brook\r\nThe pack had view of the way he took;\r\nRobin hallooed from the downland's crest,\r\nHe capped them on till they did their best.\r\nThe quarter-mile to the Wan Brook's brink\r\nWas raced as quick as a man can think.\n\r\nAnd here, as he ran to the huntsman's yelling,\r\nThe fox first felt that the pace was telling;\r\nHis body and lungs seemed all grown old,\r\nHis legs less certain, his heart less bold,\r\nThe hound-noise nearer, the hill-slope steeper,\r\nThe thud in the blood of his body deeper.\r\nHis pride in his speed, his joy in the race\r\nWere withered away, for what use was pace?\r\nHe had run his best, and the hounds ran better,\r\nThen the going worsened, the earth was wetter.\r\nThen his brush drooped down till it sometimes dragged,\r\nAnd his fur felt sick and his chest was tagged\r\nWith taggles of mud, and his pads seemed lead;\r\nIt was well for him he'd an earth ahead.\r\nDown he went to the brook and over,\r\nOut of the corn and into the clover,\r\nOver the slope that the Wan Brook drains,\r\nPast Battle Tump where they earthed the Danes,\r\nThen up the hjll that the Wan Dyke rings\r\nWhere the Sarsen Stones stand grand like kings.\n\r\nSeven Sarsens of granite grim,\r\nAs he ran them by they looked at him;\r\nAs he leaped the lip of their earthen paling\r\nThe hounds were gaining and he was failing.\n\r\nHe passed the Sarsens, he left the spur,\r\nHe pressed uphill to the blasted fir,\r\nHe slipped as he leaped the hedge; he slithered.\r\n\"He's mine,\" thought Robin. \"He's done; he's dithered.\"\n\r\nAt the second attempt he cleared the fence,\r\nHe turned half-right where the gorse was dense,\r\nHe was leading hounds by a furlong clear,\r\nHe was past his best, but his earth was near.\r\nHe ran up gorse to the spring of the ramp,\r\nThe steep green wall of the dead men's camp,\r\nHe sidled up it and scampered down\r\nTo the deep green ditch of the Dead Men's Town.\n\r\nWithin, as he reached that soft green turf,\r\nThe wind, blowing lonely, moaned like surf,\r\nDesolate ramparts rose up steep\r\nOn either side, for the ghosts to keep.\r\nHe raced the trench, past the rabbit warren,\r\nClose-grown with moss which the wind made barren;\r\nHe passed the spring where the rushes spread,\r\nAnd there in the stones was his earth ahead.\r\nOne last short burst upon failing feet,\r\nThere life lay waiting, so sweet, so sweet,\r\nRest in a darkness, balm for aches.\n\r\nThe earth was stopped. It was barred with stakes.\n\r\nWith the hounds at head so close behind\r\nHe had to run as he changed his mind.\r\nThis earth, as he saw, was stopped, but still\r\nThere was one earth more on the Wan Dyke Hill-\r\nA rabbit burrow a furlong on;\r\nHe could kennel there till the hounds were gone.\r\nThough his death seemed near he did not blench,\r\nHe upped his brush and he ran the trench.\n\r\nHe ran the trench while the wind moaned treble,\r\nEarth trickled down, there were falls of pebble.\r\nDown in the valley of that dark gash\r\nThe wind-withered grasses looked like ash.\r\nTrickles of stones and earth fell down\r\nIn that dark alley of Dead Men's Town.\r\nA hawk arose from a fluff of feathers,\r\nFrom a distant fold came a bleat of wethers.\r\nHe heard no noise from the hounds behind\r\nBut the hill-wind moaning like something blind.\n\r\nHe turned the bend in the hill, and there\r\nWas his rabbit-hole with its mouth worn bare;\r\nBut there, with a gun tucked under his arm,\r\nWas young Sid Kissop of Purlpit's Farm,\r\nWith a white hob ferret to drive the rabbit\r\nInto a net which was set to nab it.\r\nAnd young Jack Cole peered over the wall,\r\nAnd loosed a pup with a \"Z'bite en, Saul!\"\r\nThe terrier pup attacked with a will,\r\nSo the fox swerved right and away downhill.\n\r\nDown from the ramp of the Dyke he ran\r\nTo the brackeny patch where the gorse began,\r\nInto the gorse, where the hill's heave hid\r\nThe line he took from the eyes of Sid;\r\nHe swerved downwind and ran like a hare\r\nFor the wind-blown spinney below him there.\n\r\nHe slipped from the gorse to the spinney dark\r\n(There were'curled grey growths on the oak-tree bark);\r\nHe saw no more of the terrier pup,\r\nBut he heard men speak and the hounds come up.\n\r\nHe crossed the spinney with ears intent\r\nFor the cry of hounds on the way he went;\r\nHis heart was thumping, the hounds were near now,\r\nHe could make no sprint at a cry and cheer now,\r\nHe was past his perfect, his strength was failing,\r\nHis brush sag-sagged and his legs were ailing.\r\nHe felt, as he skirted Dead Men's Town,\r\nThat in one mile more they would have him down.\n\r\nThrough the withered oak's wind-crouching tops\r\nHe saw men's scarlet above the copse,\r\nHe heard men's oaths, yet he felt hounds slacken,\r\nIn the frondless stalks of the brittle bracken.\r\nHe felt that the unseen link which bound\r\nHis spine to the nose of the leading hound\r\nWas snapped, that the hounds no longer knew\r\nWhich way to follow nor what to do;\r\nThat the threat of the hound's teeth left his neck,\r\nThey had ceased to run, they had come to check.\r\nThey were quartering wide on the Wan Hill's bent.\n\r\nThe terrier's chase had killed his scent.\n\r\nHe heard bits chink as the horses shifted,\r\nHe heard hounds cast, then he heard hounds lifted,\r\nBut there came no cry from a new attack;\r\nHis heart grew steady, his breath came back.\n\r\nHe left the spinney and ran its edge\r\nBy the deep dry ditch of the blackthorn hedge;\r\nThen out of the ditch and down the meadow,\r\nTrotting at ease in the blackthorn shadow,\r\nOver the track called Godsdown Road,\r\nTo the great grass heave of the gods' abode.\r\nHe was moving now upon land he knew:\r\nUp Clench Royal and Morton Tew,\r\nThe Pol Brook, Cheddesdon, and East Stoke Church,\r\nHigh Clench St. Lawrence and Tinker's Birch.\r\nLand he had roved on night by night,\r\nFor hot blood-suckage or furry bite.\r\nThe threat of the hounds behind was gone;\r\nHe breathed deep pleasure and trotted on.\r\nWhile young Sid Kissop thrashed the pup\r\nRobin on Pip came heaving up,\r\nAnd found his pack spread out at check.\r\n\"I'd like to wring your terrier's neck,\"\r\nHe said, \"you see? He's spoiled our sport.\r\nHe's killed the scent.\" He broke off short,\r\nAnd stared at hounds and at the valley.\r\nNo jay or magpie gave a rally,\r\nDown in the copse, no circling rooks ,\r\nRose over fields; old Joyful's looks\r\nWere doubtful in the gorse, the pack\r\nQuested both up and down and back.\r\nHe watched 'each hound for each small sign.\r\nThey tried, but could not hit the line,\r\nThe scent was gone. The field took place\r\nOut of the way of hounds. The pace\r\nHad tailed them out; though four remained:\r\nSir Peter, on White Rabbit, stained\r\nRed from the brooks, Bill Ridden cheery,\r\nHugh Colway with his mare dead weary,\r\nThe Colonel with Marauder beat.\r\nThey turned towards a thud of feet;\r\nDansey, and then young Cothill came\r\n(His chestnut mare was galloped tame).\r\n\"There's Copse a field behind,\" he said.\r\n\"Those last miles put them all to bed.\r\nThey're strung along the downs like flies.\"\r\nCopse and Nob Manor topped the rise.\r\n\"Thank God! A check,\" they said, \"at last.\"\n\r\n\"They cannot own it; you must cast,\"\r\nSir Peter said. The soft horn blew,\r\nTom turned the hounds upwind. They drew\r\nUpwind, downhill, by spinney-side.\r\nThey tried the brambled ditch; they tried\r\nThe swamp, all choked with bright green grass\r\nAnd clumps of rush, and pools like glass,\r\nLong since the dead men's drinking pond.\r\nThey tried the white-leaved oak beyond,\r\nBut no hound spoke to it or feathered.\r\nThe horse-heads drooped like horses tethered,\r\nThe men mopped brows. \"An hour's hard run.\r\nTen miles,\" they said, \"we must have done.\r\nIt's all of six from Colston's Gorses.\"\r\nThe lucky got their second horses.\n\r\nThe time ticked by. \"He's lost,\" they muttered.\r\nA pheasant rose. A rabbit scuttered.\r\nMen mopped their scarlet cheeks and drank.\r\nThey drew downwind along the bank\r\n(The Wan Way) on the hill's south spur,\r\nGrown with dwarf oak and juniper,\r\nLike dwarves alive, but no hound spoke.\r\nThe seepings made the ground one soak.\r\nThey turned the spur; the hounds were beat.\r\nThen Robin shifted in his seat\r\nWatching for signs, but no signs showed.\r\n\"I'll lift across the Godsdown Road\r\nBeyond the spinney,\" Robin said.\r\nTom turned them; Robin went ahead.\n\r\nBeyond the copse a great grass fallow\r\nStretched towards Stoke and Cheddesdon Mallow,\r\nA rolling grass where hounds grew keen.\r\n\" Yoi do it, then! This is where he's been,\"\r\nSaid Robin, eager at their joy.\r\n\"Yooi, Joyful, lad! Yooi, Cornerboy!\r\nThey're on to him.\"\r\nAt his reminders\r\nThe keen hounds hurried to the finders.\r\nThe finding hounds began to hurry,\r\nMen jammed their hats, prepared to scurry.\r\nThe \"Ai, Ai,\" of the cry began,\r\nIts spirit passed to horse and man;\r\nThe skirting hounds romped to the cry.\r\nHound after hound cried \"Ai, Ai, Ai,\"\r\nTill all were crying, running, closing,\r\nTheir heads well up and no heads nosing.\r\nJoyful ahead with spear-straight stern\r\nThey raced the great slope to the burn,\r\nRobin beside them, Tom behind\r\nPointing past Robin down the wind.\n\r\nFor there, two furlongs on, he viewed\r\nOn Holy Hill or Cheddesdon Rood,\r\nJust where the plough land joined the grass,\r\nA speck down the first furrow pass,\r\nA speck the colour of the plough.\r\n\"Yonder he goes. We'll have him now,\"\r\nHe cried. The speck passed slowly on,\r\nIt reached the ditch, paused, and was gone.\n\r\nThen down the slope and up the Rood\r\nWent the hunt's gallop. Godsdown Wood\r\nDropped its last oak-leaves at the rally.\r\nOver the Rood to High Clench Valley\r\nThe gallop led: the redcoats scattered,\r\nThe fragments of the hunt were tattered\r\nOver five fields, ev'n since the check.\r\n'A dead fox or a broken neck,\"\r\nSaid Robin Dawe. \"Come up, the Dane.\"\r\nThe hunter lent against the rein,\r\nCocking his ears; he loved to see\r\nThe hounds at cry. The hounds and he\r\nThe chiefs in all that feast of pace.\n\r\nThe speck in front began to race.\r\nThe fox heard hounds get on to his line,\r\nAnd again the terror went down his spine;\r\nAgain the back of his neck felt cold,\r\nFrom the sense of the hound's teeth taking hold.\r\nBut his legs were rested, his heart was good,\r\nHe had breath to gallop to Mourne End Wood;\r\nIt was four miles more, but an earth at end,\r\nSo he put on pace down the Rood Hill Bend.\n\r\nDown the great grass slope which the oak-trees dot,\r\nWith a swerve to the right from the keeper's cot,\r\nOver High Clench Brook in its channel deep,\r\nTo the grass beyond, where he ran to sheep.\n\r\nThe sheep formed line like a troop of horse,\r\nThey swerved, as he passed, to front his course.\r\nFrom behind, as he ran, a cry arose:\r\n\"See the sheep there. Watch them. There he goes!\"\n\r\nHe ran the sheep that their smell might check\r\nThe hounds from his scent and save his neck,\r\nBut in two fields more he was made aware\r\nThat the hounds still ran; Tom had viewed him there.\n\r\nTom had held them on through the taint of sheep;\r\nThey had kept his line, as they meant to keep.\r\nThey were running hard with a burning scent,\r\nAnd Robin could see which way he went.\r\nThe pace that he went brought strain to breath,\r\nHe knew as he ran that the grass was death.\n\r\nHe ran the slope towards Morton Tew\r\nThat the heave of the hill might stop the view,\r\nThen he doubled down to the Blood Brook red,\r\nAnd swerved upstream in the brook's deep bed.\r\nHe splashed the shallows, he swam the deeps,\r\nHe crept by banks as a moorhen creeps;\r\nHe heard the hounds shoot over his line,\r\nAnd go on, on, on, towards Cheddesdon Zine.\n\r\nIn the minute's peace he could slacken speed,\r\nThe ease from the strain was sweet indeed.\r\nCool to the pads the water flowed.\r\nHe reached the bridge on the Cheddesdon Road.\n\r\nAs he came to light from the culvert dim\r\nTwo boys on the bridge looked down on him;\r\nThey were young Bill Ripple and Harry Meun:\r\n\"Look, there be squirrel, a-swimmin', see 'un?\"\r\n\"Noa, ben't a squirrel, be fox, be fox.\r\nNow, Hal, get pebble, we'll give 'en socks.\"\r\nGet pebble, Billy, dub 'un a plaster;\r\nThere's for thy belly, I'll learn 'ee, master.\"\n\r\nThe stones splashed spray in the fox's eyes,\r\nHe raced from brook in a burst of shies,\r\nHe ran for the reeds in the withy car,\r\nWhere the dead flags shake and the wild-duck are.\n\r\nHe pushed through the reeds, which cracked at his passing,\r\nTo the High Clench Water, a grey pool glassing;\r\nHe heard Bill Ripple, in Cheddesdon Road,\r\nShout, \"This way, huntsmen, it's here he goed.\"\n\r\nThen \"Leu, Leu, Leu,\" went the soft horn's laughter,\r\nThe hounds (they had checked) came romping after;\r\nThe clop of the hooves on the road was plain,\r\nThen the crackle of reeds, then cries again.\n\r\nA whimpering first, then Robin's cheer,\r\nThen the \"Ai, Ai, Ai \"; they were all too near;\r\nHis swerve had brought but a minute's rest;\r\nNow he ran again, and he ran his best.\n\r\nWith a crackle of dead dry stalks of reed\r\nThe hounds came romping at topmost speed;\r\nThe redcoats ducked as the great hooves skittered\r\nThe Blood Brook's shallows to sheets that glittered;\r\nWith a cracking whip and a \"Hoik, Hoik, Hoik,\r\nForrard!' Tom galloped. Bob shouted \" Yoick!\"\r\nLike a running fire the dead reeds crackled;\r\nThe hounds' heads lifted, their necks were hackled.\r\nTom cried to Bob, as they thundered through,\r\n\"He is running short, we shall kill at Tew.\"\r\nBob cried to Tom as they rode in team,\r\n\"I was sure, that time, that he turned upstream.\r\nAs the hounds went over the brook in stride\r\nI saw old Daffodil fling to side,\r\nSo I guessed at once, when they checked beyond.\"\n\r\nThe ducks flew up from the Morton Pond;\r\nThe fox looked up at their tailing strings,\r\nHe wished (perhaps) that a fox had wings,\r\nWings with his friends in a great V straining\r\nThe autumn sky when the moon is gaining;\r\nFor better the grey sky's solitude\r\nThan to be two miles from the Mourne End Wood\r\nWith the hounds behind, clean-trained to run,\r\nAnd your strength half spent and your breath half done.\r\nBetter the reeds and the sky and water\r\nThan that hopeless pad from a certain slaughter.\r\nAt the Morton Pond the fields began-\r\nLong Tew's green meadows; he ran, he ran.\n\r\nFirst the six green fields that make a mile,\r\nWith the lip-ful Clench at the side the while,\r\nWith rooks above, slow-circling, showing\r\nThe world of men where a fox was going;\r\nThe fields all empty, dead grass, bare hedges,\r\nAnd the brook's bright gleam in the dark of sedges.\r\nTo all things else he was dumb and blind;\r\nHe ran with the hounds a field behind.\n\r\nAt the sixth green field came the long slow climb\r\nTo the Mourne End Wood, as old as time;\r\nYew woods dark, where they cut for bows,\r\nOak woods green with the mistletoes,\r\nDark woods evil, but burrowed deep\r\nWith a brock's earth strong, where a fox might sleep.\r\nHe saw his point on the heaving hill,\r\nHe had failing flesh and a reeling will;\r\nHe felt the heave of the hill grow stiff,\r\nHe saw black woods, which would shelter-if\r\nNothing else, but the steepening slope\r\nAnd a black line nodding, a line of hope-\r\nThe line of the yews on the long slope's brow,\r\nA mile, three-quarters, a half-mile now.\n\r\nA quarter-mile, but the hounds had viewed;\r\nThey yelled to have him this side the wood.\r\nRobin capped them, Tom Dansey steered them;\r\nWith a \"Yooi! Yooi! Yooi!\" Bill Ridden cheered them.\r\nThen up went hackles as Shatterer led.\r\n\"Mob him!\" cried Ridden, \"the wood's ahead.\r\nTurn him, damn it! Yooi! beauties, beat him!\r\n0 God, let them get him: let them eat him!\r\n0 God!\" said Ridden, \"I'll eat him stewed,\r\nIf you'll let us get him this side the wood.\"\n\r\nBut the pace, uphill, made a horse like stone;\r\nThe pack went wild up the hill alone.\n\r\nThree hundred yards and the worst was past,\r\nThe slope was gentler and shorter-grassed;\r\nThe fox saw the bulk of the woods grow tall\r\nOn the brae ahead, like a barrier-wall.\r\nHe saw the skeleton trees show sky\r\nAnd the yew-trees darken to see him die,\r\nAnd the line of the woods go reeling black:\r\nThere was hope in the woods-and behind, the pack.\n\r\nTwo hundred yards and the trees grew taller,\r\nBlacker, blinder, as hope grew smaller;\r\nCry seemed nearer, the teeth seemed gripping,\r\nPulling him back; his pads seemed slipping.\r\nHe was all one ache, one gasp, one thirsting,\r\nHeart on his chest-bones, beating, bursting;\r\nThe hounds were gaining like spotted pards,\r\nAnd the wood hedge still was a hundred yards.\n\r\nThe wood hedge black was a two-year, quick\r\nCut-and-laid that had sprouted thjck\r\nThorns all over and strongly plied,\r\nWith a clean red ditch on the take-off side.\n\r\nHe saw it now as a redness, topped\r\nWith a wattle of thorn-work spiky cropped,\r\nSpiky to leap on, stiff to force,\r\nNo safe jump for a failing horse;\r\nBut beyond it darkness of yews together,\r\nDark green plumes over soft brown feather,\r\nDarkness of woods where scents were blowing\r\nStrange scents, hot scents, of wild things going,\r\nScents that might draw these hounds away.\r\nSo he ran, ran, ran to that clean red clay.\n\r\nStill, as he ran, his pads slipped back,\r\nAll his strength seemed to draw, the pack,\r\nThe trees drew over him dark like Norns,\r\nHe was over the ditch and at the thorns.\n\r\nI He thrust at the thorns, which would not yield;\r\nHe leaped, but fell, in sight of the field.\r\nThe hounds went wild as they saw him fall,\r\nThe fence stood stiff like a Bucks flint wall.\n\r\nHe gathered himself for a new attempt;\r\nHis life before was an old dream dreamt,\r\nAll that he was was a blown fox quaking,\r\nJumping at thorns too stiff for breaking,\r\nWhile over the grass in crowd, in cry,\r\nCame the grip teeth grinning to make him die,\r\nThe eyes intense, dull, smouldering red,\r\nThe fell like a ruff round each keen head,\r\nThe pace like fire, and scarlet men\r\nGalloping, yelling, \"Yooi, eat him, then!\"\n\r\nHe gathered himself, he leaped, he reached\r\nThe top of the hedge like a fish-boat beached.\r\nHe steadied a second and then leaped down\r\nTo the dark of the wood where bright things drown.\n\r\nHe swerved, sharp right, under young green firs.\r\nRobin called on the Dane with spurs.\r\nHe cried, \"Come, Dansey; if God's not good,\r\nWe shall change our fox in this Mourne End Wood.\"\r\nTom cried back as he charged like spate,\r\n\"Mine can't jump that, I must ride to gate.\"\r\nRobin answered, \"I'm going at him.\r\nI'll kill that fox, if it kills me, drat him!\r\nWe'll kill in covert. Gerr on, now, Dane.\"\r\nHe gripped him tight and he made it plain,\r\nHe slowed him down till he almost stood,\r\nWhile his hounds went crash into Mourne End Wood.\n\r\nLike a dainty dancer, with footing nice\r\nThe Dane turned side for a leap in twice.\r\nHe cleared the ditch to the red clay bank,\r\nHe rose at the fence as his quarters sank,\r\nHe barged the fence as the bank gave way,\r\nAnd down he came in a fall of clay.\n\r\nRobin jumped off him and gasped for breath,\r\nHe said, \"That's lost him as sure as death.\r\nThey've overrun him. Come up, the Dane.\r\nWe'll kill him yet, if we ride to Spain.\"\n\r\nHe scrambled up to his horse's back,\r\nHe thrust through cover, he called his pack;\r\nHe cheered them on till they made it good,\r\nWhere the fox had swerved inside the wood.\n\r\nThe fox knew well as he ran the dark,\r\nThat the headlong hounds were past their mark:\r\nThey had missed his swerve and had overrun,\r\nBut their devilish play was not yet done.\n\r\nFor a minute he ran and he heard no sound,\r\nThen a whimper came from a questing hound,\r\nThen a \"This way, beauties,\" and then \"Leu, Leu,\"\r\nThe floating laugh of the horn that blew.\r\nThen the cry again, and the crash and rattle\r\nOf the shrubs burst back as they ran to battle,\r\nTill the wood behind seemed risen from root,\r\nCrying and crashing, to give pursuit,\r\nTill the trees seemed hounds and the air seemed cry,\r\nAnd the earth so far that he needs but die,\r\nDie where he reeled in the woodland dim,\r\nWith a hound's white grips in the spine of him;\r\nFor one more burst he could spurt, and then\r\nWait for the teeth, and the wrench, and men.\n\r\nHe made his spurt for the Mourne End rocks.\r\nThe air blew rank with the taint of fox;\r\nThe yews gave way to a greener space\r\nOf great stones strewn in a grassy place.\r\nAnd there was his earth at the great grey shoulder,\r\nSunk in the ground, of a granite boulder.\r\nA dry, deep burrow with a rocky roof,\r\nProof against crowbars, terrier-proof,\r\nLife to the dying, rest for bones.\n\r\nThe earth was stopped; it was filled with stones.\n\r\nThen, for a moment, his courage failed,\r\nHis eyes looked up as his body quailed,\r\nThen the coming of death, which all things dread,\r\nMade him run for the wood ahead.\n\r\nThe taint of fox was rank on the air,\r\nHe knew, as he ran, there were foxes there.\r\nHis strength was broken, his heart was bursting,\r\nHis bones were rotten, his throat was thirsting;\r\nHis feet were reeling, his brush was thick\r\nFrom dragging the mud, and his brain was sick.\n\r\nHe thought as he ran of his old delight\r\nIn the wood in the moon in an April night,\r\nHis happy hunting, his winter loving,\r\nThe smells of things in the midnight roving,\r\nThe look of his dainty-nosing, red,\r\nClean-felled dam with her footpad's tread;\r\nOf his sire, so swift, so game, so cunning,\r\nWith craft in his brain and power of running;\r\nTheir fights of old when his teeth drew blood,\r\nNow he was sick, with his coat all mud.\n\r\nHe crossed the covert, he crawled the bank,\r\nTo a meuse in the thorns, and there he sank,\r\nWith his ears flexed back and his teeth shown white,\r\nIn a rat's resolve for a dying bite.\n\r\nAnd there, as he lay, he saw the vale,\r\nThat a struggling sunlight silvered pale:\r\nThe Deerlip Brook like a strip of steel,\r\nThe Nun's Wood Yews where the rabbits squeal,\r\nThe great grass square of the Roman Fort,\r\nAnd the smoke in the elms at Crendon Court.\n\r\nAnd above the smoke in the elm-tree tops\r\nWas the beech-clump's blur, Blown Hilcote Copse\r\nWhere he and his mates had long made merry\r\nIn the bloody joys of the rabbit-herry.\n\r\nAnd there as he lay and looked, the cry\r\nOf the hounds at head came rousing by;\r\nHe bent his bones in the blackthorn dim.\n\r\nBut the cry of the hounds was not for him.\r\nOver the fence with a crash they went,\r\nBelly to grass, with a burning scent;\r\nThen came Dansey, yelling to Bob:\r\n\"They've changed! Oh, damn it! now here's a job.\"\r\nAnd Bob yelled back: \"Well, we cannot turn 'em,\r\nIt's jumper and Antic, Tom, we'll learn 'em!\r\nWe must just go on, and I hope we kill.\"\r\nThey followed hounds down the Mourne End Hill.\n\r\nThe fox lay still in the rabbit-meuse,\r\nOn the dry brown dust of the plumes of yews.\r\nIn the bottom below a brook went by,\r\nBlue, in a patch, like a streak of sky.\r\nThere one by one, with a clink of stone,\r\nCame a red or dark coat on a horse half-blown.\r\nAnd man to man with a gasp for breath\r\nSaid: \"Lord, what a run! I'm fagged to death.\"\n\r\nAfter an hour no riders came,\r\nThe day drew by like an ending game;\r\nA robin sang from a pufft red breast,\r\nThe fox lay quiet and took his rest.\r\nA wren on a tree-stump carolled clear,\r\nThen the starlings wheeled in a sudden sheer,\r\nThe rooks came home to the twiggy hive\r\nIn the elm-tree tops which the winds do drive.\r\nThen the noise of the rooks fell slowly still,\r\nAnd the lights came out in the Clench Brook Mill;\r\nThen a pheasant cocked, then an owl began,\r\nWith the cry that curdles the blood of man.\n\r\nThe stars grew bright as the yews grew black,\r\nThe fox rose stifly and stretched his back.\r\nHe flaired the air, then he padded out\r\nTo the valley below him, dark as doubt,\r\nWinter-thin with the young green crops,\r\nFor old Cold Crendon and Hilcote Copse.\n\r\nAs he crossed the meadows at Naunton Larking\r\nThe dogs in town all started barking,\r\nFor with feet all bloody and flanks all foam,\r\nThe hounds and the hunt were limping home;\r\nLimping home in the dark dead-beaten,\r\nThe hounds all rank from a fox they'd eaten.\r\nDansey saying to Robin Dawe :\r\n\"The fastest and longest I ever saw.\"\r\nAnd Robin answered: \"Oh, Tom, 'twas good!\r\nI thought they'd changed in the Mourne End Wood,\r\nBut now I feel that they did not change.\r\nWe've had a run that was great and strange;\r\nAnd to kill in the end, at dusk, on grass!\r\nWe'll turn to the Cock and take a glass,\r\nFor the hounds, poor souls! are past their forces;\r\nAnd a gallon of ale for our poor horses,\r\nAnd some bits of bread for the hounds, poor things!\r\nAfter all they've done (for they've done like kings),\r\nWould keep them going till we get in.\r\nWe had it alone from the Nun's Wood Whin\".\r\nThen Tom replied: \"If they changed or not,\r\nThere've been few runs longer and none more hot.\r\nWe shall talk of to-day until we die.\"\n\r\nThe stars grew bright in the winter sky,\r\nThe wind came keen with a tang of frost,\r\nThe brook was troubled for new things lost,\r\nThe copse was happy for old things found,\r\nThe fox came home and he went to ground.\n\r\nAnd the hunt came home and the hounds were fed,\r\nThey climbed to their bench and went to bed;\r\nThe horses in stable loved their straw.\r\n\"Good-night, my beauties,\" said Robin Dawe.\n\r\nThen the moon came quiet and flooded full\r\nLight and beauty on clouds like wool,\r\nOn a feasted fox at rest from hunting,\r\nIn the beech-wood grey where the brocks were grunting.\n\r\nThe beech-wood grey rose dim in the night\r\nWith moonlight fallen in pools of light,\r\nThe long dead leaves on the ground were rimed;\r\nA clock struck twelve and the church-bells chimed.",

Time was not.\r\nUnheeded and unfelt, it fled.\r\nWe read and hardly knew we read.\n\r\nUntil beneath a sadder sun,\r\nWe came to know the book was done.\r\nThen, as our minds were but new lit,\r\nIt dawned upon us what was writ;\n\r\nAnd we were startled. In our eyes,\r\nLooked forth the light of great surprise.\r\nThen as a deep-toned tocsin tolls,\r\nA voice spoke forth: \"Behold your souls!\"\n\r\nI do, I do.

The great clock in its tower\r\nTicks with reverberant coil and tolls the hour:\r\nAt the deep sudden stroke the pigeons fly . . .\r\nThe fine snow flutes the cracks between the flagstones.\r\nWe close our coats, and hurry, and search the sky.\n\r\nWe are like music, each voice of it pursuing\r\nA golden separate dream, remote, persistent,\r\nClimbing to fire, receding to hoarse despair.\r\nWhat do you whisper, brother? What do you tell me? . . .\r\nWe pass each other, are lost, and do not care.\n\r\nOne mounts up to beauty, serenely singing,\r\nForgetful of the steps that cry behind him;\r\nOne drifts slowly down from a waking dream.\r\nOne, foreseeing, lingers forever unmoving . . .\r\nUpward and downward, past him there, we stream.\n\r\nOne has death in his eyes: and walks more slowly.\r\nDeath, among jonquils, told him a freezing secret.\r\nA cloud blows over his eyes, he ponders earth.\r\nHe sees in the world a forest of sunlit jonquils:\r\nA slow black poison huddles beneath that mirth.\n\r\nDeath, from street to alley, from door to window,\r\nCries out his news, of unplumbed worlds approaching,\r\nOf a cloud of darkness soon to destroy the tower.\r\nBut why comes death, he asks, in a world so perfect?\r\nOr why the minute's grey in the golden hour?\n\r\nMusic, a sudden glissando, sinister, troubled,\r\nA drift of wind-torn petals, before him passes\r\nDown jangled streets, and dies.\r\nThe bodies of old and young, of maimed and lovely,\r\nAre slowly borne to earth, with a dirge of cries.\n\r\nDown cobbled streets they come; down huddled stairways;\r\nThrough silent halls; through carven golden doorways;\r\nFrom freezing rooms as bare as rock.\r\nThe curtains are closed across deserted windows.\r\nEarth streams out of the shovel; the pebbles knock.\n\r\nMary, whose hands rejoiced to move in sunlight;\r\nSilent Elaine; grave Anne, who sang so clearly;\r\nFugitive Helen, who loved and walked alone;\r\nMiriam too soon dead, darkly remembered;\r\nChildless Ruth, who sorrowed, but could not atone;\n\r\nJean, whose laughter flashed over depths of terror,\r\nAnd Eloise, who desired to love but dared not;\r\nDoris, who turned alone to the dark and cried, \r\nThey are blown away like windflung chords of music,\r\nThey drift away; the sudden music has died.\n\r\nAnd one, with death in his eyes, comes walking slowly\r\nAnd sees the shadow of death in many faces,\r\nAnd thinks the world is strange.\r\nHe desires immortal music and spring forever,\r\nAnd beauty that knows no change.",
          "I\n\r\nFrom you, Beethoven, Bach, Mozart,\r\n The substance of my dreams took fire.\r\nYou built cathedrals in my heart,\r\n And lit my pinnacled desire.\r\nYou were the ardour and the bright\r\n Procession of my thoughts toward prayer.\r\nYou were the wrath of storm, the light\r\n On distant citadels aflare.\n\r\nII\n\r\nGreat names, I cannot find you now\r\n In these loud years of youth that strives\r\nThrough doom toward peace: upon my brow\r\n I wear a wreath of banished lives.\r\nYou have no part with lads who fought\r\n And laughed and suffered at my side.\r\nYour fugues and symphonies have brought\r\n No memory of my friends who died.\n\r\nIII\n\r\nFor when my brain is on their track,\r\nIn slangy speech I call them back.\r\nWith fox-trot tunes their ghosts I charm.\r\n\"Another little drink won't do us any harm.\"\r\nI think of rag-time; a bit of rag-time;\r\nAnd see their faces crowding round\r\nTo the sound of the syncopated beat.\r\nThey've got such jolly things to tell,\r\nHome from hell with a Blighty wound so neat...\r\n*****\r\nAnd so the song breaks off; and I'm alone.\r\nThey're dead... For God's sake stop that gramophone.",

the land where first I saw\r\nThe blue of heav'n, and bursting light of day,\r\nWhere breezes warm and mild, and breezes raw,\r\nFirst o'er my boyhood's eager face did play,\r\nAs o'er the hills I stepp'd my joyful way.\r\nHeld by a loving hand, I went along\r\nThro' shelter'd wood, or by some shaded bay,\r\nAnd ever, as I went, I sang a song,\r\nWith sylvan joy, amid a sylvan throng.\n\r\nFor birds and bees, and e'en the flowers, did sing\r\nTheir cheerful songs, with voices pure and sweet;\r\nTheir notes were silent, yet those notes did bring\r\nA soothing balm, amid a calm retreat.\r\nProtected from the sun's relentless heat.\r\nOh, wearied men, could ye but once divine\r\nThe healing pow'r of some lone country seat,\r\nYou would not strive to drown your care in wine,\r\nOr vainly seek relief, in any lustful line.\n\r\nBut this is not a moralizing lay,\r\nOf Canada I sing, and her alone,\r\nHer varied progress, every passing day,\r\nHer faults, for which, in time, she must atone,\r\nBy nature's law, in every clime and zone,\r\nThen what are the peculiar, common claims,\r\nOur country has with nations larger grown,\r\nAnd the superior things she classes as her own.\n\r\nFirst let us take her climate; who will not\r\nSay she is favour'd there o'er other lands?\r\nThe winter's cold, indeed, and summer's hot,\r\nBut in a robust health the native stands,\r\nSo keen to work with brain, or use his hands.\r\nWhere, let me ask, between the distant poles\r\nIs there a clime so mod'rate in demands,\r\nWhere men are not compell'd to live like moles,\r\nNor drop with heat on burning, barren, sandy knolls.\n\r\nA hardy, energetic, toilsome race,\r\nIs raised within this favourable clime,\r\nIn physical and mental power apace\r\nWith those of any land, and any time,\r\nSave in the golden age, that age of thought sublime;\r\nBut, what I mean is this: that her own men\r\nDo act their parts, they reason or they rhyme\r\nWithin their bounds, with keen, far-reaching ken,\r\nFor those who late have left the axe to wield the pen.\n\r\nYes, left the axe, whose skilful, cleaving stroke\r\nHew'd out a home from 'mid the forest wild,\r\nWhere grew the maple and the lofty oak,\r\nWhere liv'd the dusky colour'd forest child,\r\nSo sternly fierce in war, in peace so mild;\r\nYes, here the settler met with Nature's force;\r\nQuite unsubdued, she look'd around and smil'd,\r\nAnd seem'd to view with scorn the white man's course\r\nOf labour slow, but yet of wealth the only source.\n\r\nBut still the patient white man plodded on,\r\nHe swung his axe, and drove his horned team;\r\nAt times he felt despair, but soon 'twas gone,\r\nAnd gladsome rays of hope would brightly gleam\r\nTo cheer his path, like light on darken'd stream.\r\nSome saw their hopes fulfill'd, some sank to rest\r\nAmid their toil, but, sinking, saw the beam\r\nOf brighter days, to make their children blest.\r\nAnd give a rich reward to ev'ry earnest guest.\n\r\nThese latter gaz'd on fertile fields, and saw,\r\nThe waving grain, where stood the forest tree,\r\nWhere prowl'd the bear; or wolf, with hungry maw,\r\nHowl'd in the settlers' ears so dismally,\r\nThat children crouch'd near to their mother's knee.\r\nThey saw, instead of plain, bark-roof'd abode,\r\nA mansion wide, the scene of youthful glee,\r\nAnd happy Age, now resting on his road,\r\nTo pay the debt, his sinning kind so long hath ow'd.\n\r\nThe organ or piano sounds its tone,\r\nWhere late in darkness cried the whip-poor-will,\r\nOr gloomy owl's to whoo! to whoo! alone,\r\nCame from the glen, or darkly wooded hill, - \r\nThese sounds, untaught, and unimprov'd in skill.\r\nAll round, where'er they look, they see a change,\r\nBy rolling lake, by river, mount or rill;\r\nWherever feet may walk, or eyes may range,\r\nThere is a transformation pleasing, new and strange.\n\r\nSchools, churches, built in costly, solid style,\r\nProclaim the fact that here a higher life\r\nIs liv'd than that of seeking all the while\r\nFor wealth, and pow'r, amid ignoble strife,\r\nDegrading unto husband, son or wife.\r\nThe scholar's light, and blest religion's smile\r\nEnnobles, soothes and lends a joy to life - \r\nA pow'r, which counteracts the trickster's wile\r\nAnd blunts the edge of slander undeserv'd and vile.\n\r\nFrom where the fierce Atlantic waters rage,\r\nUnto the mild Pacific's fertile shore,\r\nSmall villages to cities rise and wage\r\nA steady war; but not a war of gore - \r\nA friendly rivalry exists, no more,\r\nSave in the far North-West, where savage clan\r\nUngrateful rise, and make a serious sore,\r\nWhose pains increas'd, as eastward far it ran,\r\nAnd plac'd the British race beneath the Frenchman's ban.\n\r\nBut quickly, let us hope, the time may come,\r\nWhen peacefully the British flag shall wave,\r\nAnd when the rebels' terrorizing drum\r\nShall be as still as Kiel's rebel grave,\r\nO'er the wide land, whose sides two oceans lave;\r\nWhen demagogues of party shall retire,\r\nOr curb their selfish zeal, their land to save\r\nFrom factious feuds and savage rebel fire.\r\nAnd all that tends to raise the patriot's scorn and ire.\n\r\nFrom ocean unto ocean runs a band,\r\nA double band of hard and gleaming steel;\r\nIt binds in one this fertile, mighty land,\r\nIn bonds which all should recognize and feel,\r\nIf anxious to promote their country's weal.\r\nA bond which Nature's sympathetic law\r\nShould fasten on our hearts with solid seal,\r\nWhich factious feuds should ne'er asunder draw,\r\nNor wily traitors cut, by selfish treason's saw.\n\r\nThe strange, stupendous, magic power of steam,\r\nIn works, is great as fam'd Aladdin's ring,\r\nIt carries men o'er miles of land and stream,\r\nAnd maketh loom and forge, with labour sing,\r\nAnd o'er the land, a busy air doth fling.\r\nThat fluid, too, that none can well define,\r\nIn active life hath wrought a wondrous thing.\r\nIt speeds our words with lightning flash or sign,\r\nAnd maketh glorious light from midnight's darkness shine.\n\r\nThen to our country's future we may gaze\r\nWith gladden'd eyes, and hearts with hope aglow,\r\nThat our young country still its head will raise,\r\nAnd stand 'mid nations, in the foremost row,\r\nHigh honour'd there, and honour'd not for show - \r\nFor solid worth, and lasting pow'r and fame\r\nWill be her portion, if her footsteps go\r\nIn duty's path, and if the ruddy flame\r\nOf honor shines within, and keeps away all shame.",

And so he died!\r\nFor seventeen sweet years he was a child\r\nUpon whose grace Thy loving-kindness smiled,\r\nFor he was clean, and full of youthful pride;\r\nAnd, when his years drew on, then Thou denied\r\nThat he by man's estate should be defiled,\r\nAnd so Thou call'st him to Thy presence mild\r\nTo be with Thee for ever, by Thy side.\n\r\nNor is he dead! He lives in three great spheres.\r\nHis soul is with Thee in Thy home above:\r\nHis influence, - with friends of former years:\r\nHis memory with those he used to love.\r\nHe is an emblem of that Trinity\r\nWith whom he lives in happy ecstasy.\n\r\n Isle of Grain, 1916.",
          "Not long ago, I prayed for dying grace,\r\nFor then I thought to see Thee face to face.\n\r\nAnd now I ask (Lord, 'tis a weakling's cry)\r\nThat Thou wilt give me grace to live, not die.\n\r\nSuch foolish prayers! I know. Yet pray I must.\r\nLord help me -- help me not to see the dust!\n\r\nAnd not to nag, nor fret because the blind\r\nHangs crooked, and the curtain sags behind.\n\r\nBut, oh! The kitchen cupboards! What a sight!\r\n'T'will take at least a month to get them right.\n\r\nAnd that last cocoa had a smoky taste,\r\nAnd all the milk has boiled away to waste!\n\r\nAnd -- no, I resolutely will not think\r\nAbout the saucepans, nor about the sink.\n\r\nThese light afflictions are but temporal things --\r\nTo rise above them, wilt Thou lend me wings?\n\r\nThen I shall smile when Jane, with towzled hair\r\n(And lumpy gruel!), clatters up the stair.",
          "Some day of days! Some dawning yet to be\r\nI shall be clothed with immortality!\n\r\nAnd, in that day, I shall not greatly care\r\nThat Jane spilt candle grease upon the stair.\n\r\nIt will not grieve me then, as once it did,\r\nThat careless hands have chipped my teapot lid.\n\r\nI groan, being burdened. But, in that glad day,\r\nI shall forget vexations of the way.\n\r\nThat needs were often great, when means were small,\r\nWill not perplex me any more at all\r\nA few short years at most (it may be less),\r\nI shall have done with earthly storm and stress.\n\r\nSo, for this day, I lay me at Thy feet.\r\nO, keep me sweet, my Master! Keep me sweet!",

My faith is lost:\r\nMy former confidence is dead,\r\nAnd whispering fear has come instead.\r\nDeath ever dogs me close behind - \r\nMy frightened soul no peace can find.\r\nI feel a torture in each nerve,\r\nAs to the right or left I swerve.\r\nAnd now Imagination brings\r\nIts evil thoughts - I watch the wings,\r\nAnd wonder if those wings will break - \r\nThe tight-stretched wires seem to shake.\r\nI see the ghastly, headlong rush,\r\nAnd picture how the fall would crush\r\nMy helpless body on the ground.\r\nWith haggard eyes I turn around,\r\nAnd contemplate the rocking tail, - \r\nMy drawn and sweating cheeks are pale.\r\nFear's clammy hands clutch at my heart!\r\nI try, with unavailing art,\r\nTo summon thoughts of peaceful hours\r\nSpent in some sunny field of flowers\r\nWhen my half-opened eyes would look\r\nOn some old dream-inspiring book,\r\nAnd not on this accurs'd wheel,\r\nAnd on this box of wood and steel\r\nIn which at pitch-and-toss with Death,\r\nI play, and wonder if each breath\r\nI tensely draw, will be my last.\r\nThe happy thoughts are swiftly past - \r\nMy frightened brain forbids them stay.\r\nDear London seems so far away,\r\nAnd far away my well-loved friends!\r\nEach second my existence ends\r\nIn my disordered mind, whose pace\r\nI cannot check - its cog-wheels race,\r\nLike some ungoverned, whirring clock,\r\nWhen, frenziedly, it runs amok.\r\nI have resolved that I will climb\r\nA certain height - how slow seems time\r\nAs on its sluggish pivot creeps\r\nThe laggard finger-point, which keeps\r\nThe truthful record. O, how slow\r\nTowards the clouds I seem to go!\r\nAnd then ambition gains its mark at last!\r\nThe little finger o'er the point has passed!\r\nI can descend again. With conscience clear\r\nAnd end this battle with persistent fear!\r\nThe engine's clamour dies - there is no sound\r\nSave whistling wires - as towards the ground\r\nI gently float. My agony is gone.\r\nWhat peace is mine as I go gliding on!\r\nCalm after storm - contentment after pain - \r\nSoft sleep to some tempestuous, burning brain - \r\nThe soothing harbour after foamy seas - \r\nThe gentle feeling of a perfect ease - \r\nAll, all are mine - though yet by gusts distressed!\r\nNear is the ground, and with the ground comes rest.\r\nAbove the trees I glide - above the grass,\r\nAbove the snow-besprinkled earth I pass.\r\nI touch the ground, run swift along, and stop - \r\nAbove the wheel my tired shoulders drop.\r\nI leave my seat, and slowly move away ...\r\nCold is the wind: the clouds are grey,\r\nI only wish my room to gain,\r\nAnd in some book forget my pain,\r\nAnd lose myself in fancied dreams\r\nAcross Titania's golden streams.\n\r\n France, 1917.\n",

          "\r\n(To Maurice Baring)\n\r\nI waited for a miracle to-night.\r\nDim was the earth beneath a star-swept sky,\r\nHer boughs were vague in that phantasmal light,\r\nHer current rippled past invisibly.\r\nNo stir was in the dark and windless meadows,\r\nOnly the water, whispering in the shadows,\r\nThat darkened nature lived did still proclaim.\r\nAn hour I stood in that defeat of sight,\r\nWaiting, and then a sudden silver flame\r\nBurned in the eastern heaven, and she came.\n\r\nThe Moon, the Summer Moon, surveys the vale:\r\nThe boughs against the dawning sky grow black,\r\nThe shades that hid those whispering waters fail,\r\nAnd now there falls a gleaming, lengthening track\r\nThat lies across the wide and tranquil river,\r\nBurnished and flat, not shaken by a quiver.\r\nShe rises still: the liquid light she spills\r\nMakes everywhere quick sparkles, patches pale;\r\nAnd, as she goes, I know her glory fills\r\nThe air of all our English lakes and hills.\n\r\nHigh over all this England will she ride;\r\nShe silvers all the roofs of folded towns,\r\nHer brilliance tips the edge of every tide,\r\nHer shadows make soft caverns in the downs;\r\nEven now, beyond my tree serenely sailing,\r\nShe clothes far forests with a gauzy veiling,\r\nAnd even as here, where now I stare and dream,\r\nStanding my own transfigured banks beside,\r\nOn many a quiet wandering English stream\r\nThere lies the unshifting image of her beam.\n\r\nYes, calm she mounts, and watching her, I know\r\nBy many a river other eyes than mine\r\nTurn up to her; and, as of old, they show\r\nTheir inward hearts all naked to her shine:\r\nMaids, solitaries, sick and happy lovers,\r\nTo whom her dear returning orb discovers\r\nFor each the gift he waits for: soft release,\r\nThe unsealing of imagination's flow,\r\nHer own sweet pain, or other pain's surcease,\r\nThe friendly benediction of her peace.\n\r\nI too am held: as kind she is, as fair,\r\nAs when long since a younger heart drank deep\r\nFrom that sweet solace, while, through summer air,\r\nHer lucid fingers hushed the world to sleep.\r\nO as I stand this latest moon beholding,\r\nHer forms unresting memory is moulding;\r\nBeneath my enchanted eyelids there arise\r\nVisions again of many moons that were,\r\nFair, fleeting moons gathered from faded skies,\r\nGreeted and lost by these corporeal eyes.\n\r\nUnnumbered are those moons of memory\r\nStored in the backward chambers of my brain:\r\nThe moons that make bright pathways on the sea,\r\nThe golden harvest moon above the grain;\r\nThe moon that all a sleeping village blanches,\r\nThe woodland moon that roves beyond the branches,\r\nFiltering through the meshes of the green\r\nTo breast of bird and mossy trunk of tree;\r\nMoons dimly guessed-at through a cloudy screen,\r\nThe bronze diffusion shed by moons unseen;\n\r\nMoons that a thin prismatic halo rings,\r\nLooking a hurrying fleecy heaven through;\r\nThe fairy moons of luminous evenings,\r\nPhantoms of palest pink in palest blue;\r\nLarge orange moons on earth's grey verge suspended,\r\nWhen trees still slumber from the heat that's ended,\r\nErect and heavy, and all waters lie\r\nOily, and there is not a bird that sings.\r\nAll these I know, I have seen them born and die,\r\nAnd many another moon in many a sky.\n\r\nThere was a moon that shone above the ground\r\nWhere on a grassy forest height I stood;\r\nBright was that open place, and all around\r\nThe dense discovered tree-tops of the wood,\r\nLine after line, in misty radiance glistened,\r\nFailing away.I watched the scene and listened;\r\nThen, awed and hushed, I turned and saw alone,\r\nProtruding from the middle of the mound,\r\nFringed with close grass, a moonlit mottled stone,\r\nRough-carven, of antiquity unknown.\n\r\nA night there was, a crowd, a narrow street,\r\nTorches that reddened faces drunk with dreams,\r\nAn orator exultant in defeat,\r\nBanners, fierce songs, rough cheering, women's screams;\r\nMy heart was one with those rebellious people,\r\nUntil along a chapel's pointing steeple\r\nMy eyes unwitting wandered to a thin\r\nCrescent, and clouds a swift and ragged sheet;\r\nAnd in my spirit's life all human din\r\nDied, and eternal Silence stood within.\n\r\nAnd once, on a far evening, warm and still,\r\nI leant upon a cool stone parapet.\r\nThe quays and houses underneath the hill\r\nTwinkled with lights; I heard the sea's faint fret;\r\nAnd then above the eastern cape's long billow\r\nSilent there welled a trembling line of yellow,\r\nA shred that quickened, then a half that grew\r\nTo a full moon, that moved with even will.\r\nThe night was long before her, well she knew,\r\nAnd, as she slowly rose into the blue,\n\r\nShe slowly paled, and, glittering far away,\r\nFlung on the silken waters like a spear,\r\nHer crisp'd silver shaft of moonlight lay.\r\nThe lighthouse lamp upon the little pier\r\nBurned wanly by that radiance clear and certain.\r\nWaiting I knew not what uplifted curtain,\r\nI watched the unmoving world beneath my feet\r\nTill, without warning, miles across the bay,\r\nInto that silver out of shadows beat,\r\nDead black, the whole mysterious fishing-fleet.\n\r\nThese moons I have seen, but these and every one\r\nCame each so new it seemed to be the first,\r\nNew as the buds that open to the sun,\r\nNew as the songs that to the morning burst.\r\nThe roses die, each day fresh flowers are springing,\r\nLast year it was another blackbird singing,\r\nThou only, marvellous blossom, whose pale flower\r\nBeyond mankind's conjecture hath begun,\r\nRetain'st for ever an unwithering power\r\nThat stales the loveliest stranger of an hour.\n\r\nBut O, had all my infant nights been dark,\r\nOr almost dark, lit by the stars alone,\r\nHad never a teller of stories bid me hark\r\nThe promised splendours of that moon unknown:\r\nHow perfect then had been the revelation\r\nWhen first her gradual gold illumination\r\nBroke on a night upon the conscious child:\r\nMy heart had stopped with beauty, seeing her arc\r\nClimbing the heavens, so far and undefiled,\r\nSo large with light, so even and so mild.\n\r\nMost wondrous Light, who bring'st this lovelier earth,\r\nThis world of shadows cool with silver fires,\r\nDrawing us higher than our human birth:\r\nTo whom our strange twin-natured kind suspires\r\nIts saddest thoughts, and tenderest and most fragrant\r\nTears, and desires unnameable and vagrant:\r\nWatcher, who leanest quietly from above,\r\nSaying all mortal wars are nothing worth:\r\nFriend of the sorrowful, tranquil as the dove,\r\nMuse of all poets, lamp of all who love.\n\r\nAlone and sad, alone and kind and sweet,\r\nBut always peaceful and removed and proud,\r\nWhether with loveliness revealed complete,\r\nOr veiling from our vision in a cloud:\r\nOur souls' eternal listener, could we wonder\r\nThat men who made of sun and storm and thunder\r\nThe awful forms of strong divinity,\r\nHeard in each storm the noise of travelling feet,\r\nShould, gazing at thy face with hearts made free,\r\nHave felt a pure, immortal Power in thee?\n\r\nSelene, Cynthia, and Artemis,\r\nThe swift proud goddess with the silver bow,\r\nDiana, she whose downward-bending kiss\r\nOne only knew, though all men yearned to know;\r\nThe shepherd on a hill his flock was keeping,\r\nThe night's pale huntress came and found him sleeping:\r\nShe stooped: he woke, and saw her hair that shone,\r\nAnd lay, drawn up to cool and timeless bliss\r\nLapt in her radiant arms, Endymion,\r\nAll the still night, until the night was gone.\n\r\nBy many names they knew thee, but thy shape\r\nWas woman's always, transient and white:\r\nA flashing huntress leaving hinds agape,\r\nA sweet descent of beauty in the night:\r\nYet some, more fierce and more distraught their dreaming,\r\nBrooded, until they fashioned from thy seeming,\r\nA lithe and luring queen with fatal breath,\r\nA witch the man who saw might not escape,\r\nA snare that gleamed in shadowy groves of death,\r\nThe tall tiaraed Syrian Ashtoreth.\n\r\nAnd even to-night in African forests some\r\nThere are, possessed by such a blasphemy;\r\nThrough branching beams thy fevered votaries come\r\nTo appease their brains' distorted mask of thee.\r\nThere in the glades the drums pulsate and languish,\r\nMen leap and wail to dim the victim's anguish\r\nIn the sad frenzy of the sacrifice.\r\nThey are slaves to thee, made mad because thou art dumb,\r\nAnd dumb thou lookest on them from the skies,\r\nAbove their fires and dances, blood and cries.\n\r\nSo these; but otherwhere, at such an hour,\r\nIn all the continents, by all the seas,\r\nMen, naming not the goddess, feel thy power,\r\nAdoring her with gentler rites than these:\r\nThe thoughts of myriad hearts to thee uplifted\r\nRise like a smoke above thine altars drifted,\r\nPerpetual incense poured before thy throne\r\nBy those whom thou hast given thy secret dower,\r\nThose in whose kindred eyes thy light is known,\r\nWhom thou hast signed and sealed for thine own.\n\r\nFor thee they watch by Asian peaks remote,\r\nWhere thy snows gleam above the pointing pines;\r\nEntranced on templed lakes is many a boat\r\nFor thee, where clear thy dropt reflection shines;\r\nOn the great seas where nothing else is tender,\r\nRising and setting, unto thee surrender\r\nAll lonely hearts in lonely wandering ships;\r\nAnd, where their warm far-scattered islands float,\r\nThrough forests many a flower-crowned maiden slips\r\nTo gaze on thee, with parted burning lips.\n\r\nO thus they do, and thus they did of old;\r\nOur hearts were never secret in thy sight;\r\nEre our first records were thy shrine was cold\r\nThat speechless eyes went seeking in the night;\r\nBeyond the compass of our dim traditions\r\nThou knewest of men the pitiful ambitions,\r\nTheir loves and their despair; within thy ken\r\nAll our poor history has been unrolled;\r\nThou hast seen all races born and die again,\r\nThe climbing and the crumbling towers of men.\n\r\nBlack were the hollows of that Emperor's eyes\r\nWho paced with backward arms beyond his tents,\r\nLone in the night, and felt above him rise\r\nThe ancient conqueror's sloping, smooth, immense,\r\nMoon-pointing Pyramid's enduring courses,\r\nHeard not his sentries, nor his stamping horses,\r\nBut thought of Egypt dead upon that air,\r\nFighting with his moon-coloured memories\r\nOf vanished kings who builded, and the bare\r\nSands in the moon before those builders were.\n\r\nRestless, he knew that moon who watched him muse,\r\nHad seen a restless C'sar brood on fame\r\nAmid the Pharaohs' broken avenues.\r\nAnd, circling round that fixed monition, came\r\nWoven by moonlight, random, transitory,\r\nFragments of all the dim receding story:\r\nThe moonlit water dripping from the oars\r\nOf triremes in the bay of Syracuse;\r\nThe opposing bivouacs upon the shores,\r\nThat knew dead Hector's and Achilles' wars.\n\r\nHe saw fall'n Carthage, Alexander's grave,\r\nThe tomb of Moses in the wilderness,\r\nThe moonlight on the Atlantean wave\r\nThat covered all a multitude's distress:\r\nCities and hosts and emperors departed\r\nUnder the steady moon.And sullen-hearted\r\nHe turned away, and, in a little, died,\r\nEven as he who hunted from his cave\r\nAnd struck his foe, and stripped the shaggy hide\r\nUnder the moon, and was not satisfied.\n\r\nFor in the prime, thy influence was felt;\r\nWhen eyes first saw, thy beauty was as this;\r\nThy quiet look bade hope, fear, passion melt\r\nBefore men dreamed of empire.The abyss\r\nOf thought yawned through their jungle then, as ever\r\nDark past, dark future, menaced their endeavour:\r\nYet, on thy nights, stood some by hill and sea\r\nNaked; and blind impulsive spirits knelt,\r\nNot questioning why they knelt, feeling in thee\r\nThought's strangest, sweetest, saddest mystery.\n\r\nStill Moon, bright Moon, compassionate Moon above,\r\nThou shinedst there ere any life began,\r\nWhen of his pain or of his powerless love\r\nThou heardest not from heart of any man;\r\nThough long the earth had shaken off the vapour\r\nLeft by the vanished gleams of fire, the shaper,\r\nOld, old, her stony wrinkled face did grow\r\nWhilst only her blind elements did move;\r\nDumb, bare, and prayerless thou saw'st her go,\r\nAnd afterwards again shalt see her so.\n\r\nA time there was when Life had never been,\r\nA time will be, it will have passed away;\r\nStill wilt thou shine, still tender and serene,\r\nWhen Life which in thy sister's yesterday\r\nHad never flowered, will have drooped and faded;\r\nPassed with the clouds that once her bosom shaded.\r\nShe will be barren then as not before,\r\nBared of her snows and all her garments green;\r\nNo darkling sea by any earthly shore\r\nWill take thy rays: thy kin will be no more.\n\r\nPale satellite, old mistress of our fires,\r\nWho hast seen so much and been so much to men,\r\nSymbol and goal of all our wild desires,\r\nNot any voice will cry upon thee then;\r\nDreamer and dream, they will have all gone over,\r\nThe sick of heart, the singer and the lover,\r\nAn end there will have been to all their lust,\r\nTheir sorrow, and the sighing of their lyres;\r\nO all this Life that stained Earth's patient crust,\r\nTime's dying breath will have blown away like dust.\n\r\nGone from thine eye that brief confus'd stir,\r\nThe rumours and the marching and the strife;\r\nEarth will be still, and all the face of her\r\nSwept of the last remains of moving life;\r\nThe last of all men's monuments that defied them,\r\nLike those his valiant gestures that denied them,\r\nInto the waiting elements will fade,\r\nAnd thou wilt see thy fellow traveller,\r\nA forlorn round of rocky contours made,\r\nA glimmering disk of empty light and shade,\n\r\nAh, depth too deep for thought therein to cast;\r\nThe old, the cold companions, you will go,\r\nObeying still some long-forgotten past,\r\nAnd all our pitiful history none will know;\r\nStill shining, Moon, still peaceful, wilt thou wander,\r\nBut on that greater ball no heart will ponder\r\nThe thought that rose and nightingale are gone,\r\nAnd all sweet things but thou; and only vast\r\nRidges of rock remain, and stars and sun;\r\nO Moon, thou wilt be lovely alone for none.\n\r\nAnd so, pale wanderer, so thou leavest me,\r\nPassing beyond imagination's range,\r\nAway into the void where waits for thee\r\nThy inconceivable destiny of change;\r\nAnd after all the memories I have striven\r\nTo paint, this picture that thyself hast given\r\nLives, and I watch, to all those others blind,\r\nThy form, gliding into eternity,\r\nFading, an unconjectured fate to find,\r\nThe last, most wonderful image of the mind.\n",
          "An angel was tired of heaven, as he lounged in the golden street;\r\nHis halo was tilted sideways, and his harp lay mute at his feet;\r\nSo the Master stooped in His pity, and gave him a pass to go,\r\nFor the space of a moon, to the earth-world, to mix with the men below.\n\r\nHe doffed his celestial garments, scarce waiting to lay them straight;\r\nHe bade goodbye to Peter, who stood by the golden gate;\r\nThe sexless singers of heaven chanted a fond farewell,\r\nAnd the imps looked up as they pattered on the red-hot flags of hell.\n\r\nNever was seen such an angel: eyes of a heavenly blue,\r\nFeatures that shamed Apollo, hair of a golden hue;\r\nThe women simply adored him, his lips were like Cupid's bow;\r\nBut he never ventured to use them - and so they voted him slow.\n\r\nTill at last there came One Woman, a marvel of loveliness,\r\nAnd she whispered to him: \"Do you love me?\" And he answered that woman, \"Yes.\"\r\nAnd she said: \"Put your arms around me, and kiss me, and hold me - so - \"\r\nBut fiercely he drew back, saying: \"This thing is wrong, and I know.\"\n\r\nThen sweetly she mocked his scruples, and softly she him beguiled:\r\n\"You, who are verily man among men, speak with the tongue of a child.\r\nWe have outlived the old standards; we have burst, like an over-tight thong,\r\nThe ancient, outworn, puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong.\"\n\r\nThen the Master feared for His angel, and called him again to His side,\r\nFor oh, the woman was wondrous, and oh, the angel was tried.\r\nAnd deep in his hell sang the Devil, and this was the strain of his song:\r\n\"The ancient, outworn, puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong.\"",
          " Written as a tribute to my brother, W. M. Strang, with the Engineers.\n\n\r\nHe said, \"I'm Daddy's soldier boy,\"\r\nWhen he was five years old;\r\nAnd then went out and built snow forts,\r\nAlthough the day was cold.\n\r\nThe snowballs were his hand grenades,\r\nA stick his bayonette;\r\nAnd with a home-made wooden gun\r\nThe foe he bravely met.\n\r\nIn five more years he joined the \"scouts\"\r\nAnd hiked across the hills;\r\nHe learned to wear a khaki suit,\r\nAnd do military drills.\n\r\nAnd so the years passed swiftly on,\r\nAnd now he is a man;\r\nHe's in the trenches over there,\r\nFighting for Uncle Sam.\n\r\nI know he'll make the Huns regret\r\nThey started this big fight,\r\nFor he knows the cause he's fighting for\r\nIs liberty and right.",

So he sought\r\nThe twittering forest at the break of day,\r\nOr on fantastic mountains shaped a thought\r\nAs lofty and impenitent as they.\n\r\nAnd next he went in wonder through a town\r\nSlowly by day and hurriedly by night,\r\nAnd watched men walking up the street and down\r\nWith timorous and terrible delight.\n\r\nWeary, he drew man's wisdom from a book,\r\nAnd pondered on the high words spoken of old,\r\nPacing a lamplit room: but soon forsook\r\nThe golden sentences that left him cold.\n\r\nAfter, a woman found him, and his head\r\nLay on her breast, till he forgot his pain\r\nIn gentle kisses on a midnight bed,\r\nAnd welcomed royal-winged joy again.\n\r\nWhen love became a loathing, as it must,\r\nHe knew not where to turn; and he was wise,\r\nBeing now old, to sink among the dust,\r\nAnd rest his rebel heart, and close his eyes.",

          "Florence, rejoice! For thou o'er land and sea\r\nSo spread'st thy pinions that the fame of thee\r\nHath reached no less into the depths of Hell.\r\nSo noble were the five I found to dwell\r\nTherein - thy sons - whence shame accrues to me\r\nAnd no great praise is thine; but if it be\r\nThat truth unveil in dreamings before dawn,\r\nThen is the vengeful hour not far withdrawn\r\nWhen Prato shall exult within her walls\r\nTo see thy suffering. Whate'er befalls,\r\nLet it come soon, since come it must, for later,\r\nEach year would see my grief for thee the greater.\n\r\n We left; and once more up the craggy side\r\nBy the blind steps of our descent, my guide,\r\nRemounting, drew me on. So we pursued\r\nThe rugged path through that steep solitude,\r\nWhere rocks and splintered fragments strewed the land\r\nSo thick, that foot availed not without hand.\r\nGrief filled me then, and still great sorrow stirs\r\nMy heart as oft as memory recurs\r\nTo what I saw; that more and more I rein\r\nMy natural powers, and curb them lest they strain\r\nWhere Virtue guide not, - that if some good star,\r\nOr better thing, have made them what they are,\r\nThat good I may not grudge, nor turn to ill.\n\r\n As when, reclining on some verdant hill - \r\nWhat season the hot sun least veils his power\r\nThat lightens all, and in that gloaming hour\r\nThe fly resigns to the shrill gnat - even then,\r\nAs rustic, looking down, sees, o'er the glen,\r\nVineyard, or tilth where lies his husbandry,\r\nFireflies innumerable sparkle: so to me,\r\nCome where its mighty depth unfolded, straight\r\nWith flames no fewer seemed to scintillate\r\nThe shades of the eighth pit. And as to him\r\nWhose wrongs the bears avenged, dim and more dim\r\nElijah's chariot seemed, when to the skies\r\nUprose the heavenly steeds; and still his eyes\r\nStrained, following them, till naught remained in view\r\nBut flame, like a thin cloud against the blue:\r\nSo here, the melancholy gulf within,\r\nWandered these flames, concealing each its sin,\r\nYet each, a fiery integument,\r\nWrapped round a sinner.\n\r\n On the bridge intent,\r\nGazing I stood, and grasped its flinty side,\r\nOr else, unpushed, had fallen. And my guide,\r\nObserving me so moved, spake, saying: \"Behold\r\nWhere swathed each in his unconsuming fold,\r\nThe spirits lie confined.\" Whom answering,\r\n\"Master,\" I said, \"thy words assurance bring\r\nTo that which I already had supposed;\r\nAnd I was fain to ask who lies enclosed\r\nIn the embrace of that dividing fire,\r\nWhich seems to curl above the fabled pyre,\r\nWhere with his twin-born brother, fiercely hated,\r\nEteocles was laid.\" He answered, \"Mated\r\nIn punishment as once in wrath they were,\r\nUlysses there and Diomed incur\r\nThe eternal pains; there groaning they deplore\r\nThe ambush of the horse, which made the door\r\nFor Rome's imperial seed to issue: there\r\nIn anguish too they wail the fatal snare\r\nWhence dead Deidamia still must grieve,\r\nReft of Achilles; likewise they receive\r\nDue penalty for the Palladium.\"\r\n\"Master,\" I said, \"if in that martyrdom\r\nThe power of human speech may still be theirs,\r\nI pray - and think it worth a thousand prayers - \r\nThat, till this horned flame be come more nigh,\r\nWe may abide here; for thou seest that I\r\nWith great desire incline to it.\" And he:\r\n\"Thy prayer deserves great praise; which willingly\r\nI grant; but thou refrain from speaking; leave\r\nThat task to me; for fully I conceive\r\nWhat thing thou wouldst, and it might fall perchance\r\nThat these, being Greeks, would scorn thine utterance.\"\n\r\n So when the flame had come where time and place\r\nSeemed not unfitting to my guide with grace\r\nTo question, thus he spoke at my desire:\r\n\"O ye that are two souls within one fire,\r\nIf in your eyes some merit I have won - \r\nMerit, or more or less - for tribute done\r\nWhen in the world I framed my lofty verse:\r\nMove not; but fain were we that one rehearse\r\nBy what strange fortunes to his death he came.\"\r\nThe elder crescent of the antique flame\r\nBegan to wave, as in the upper air\r\nA flame is tempest-tortured, here and there\r\nTossing its angry height, and in its sound\r\nAs human speech it suddenly had found,\r\nRolled forth a voice of thunder, saying: \"When,\r\nThe twelvemonth past in Circe's halls, again\r\nI left Gaeta's strand (ere thither came\r\nAeneas, and had given it that name)\r\nNot love of son, nor filial reverence,\r\nNor that affection that might recompense\r\nThe weary vigil of Penelope,\r\nCould so far quench the hot desire in me\r\nTo prove more wonders of the teeming earth, - \r\nOf human frailty and of manly worth.\r\nIn one small bark, and with the faithful band\r\nThat all awards had shared of Fortune's hand,\r\nI launched once more upon the open main.\r\nBoth shores I visited as far as Spain, - \r\nSardinia, and Morocco, and what more\r\nThe midland sea upon its bosom wore.\r\nThe hour of our lives was growing late\r\nWhen we arrived before that narrow strait\r\nWhere Hercules had set his bounds to show\r\nThat there Man's foot shall pause, and further none shall go.\r\nBorne with the gale past Seville on the right,\r\nAnd on the left now swept by Ceuta's site,\r\n'Brothers,' I cried, 'that into the far West\r\nThrough perils numberless are now addressed,\r\nIn this brief respite that our mortal sense\r\nYet hath, shrink not from new experience;\r\nBut sailing still against the setting sun,\r\nSeek we new worlds where Man has never won\r\nBefore us. Ponder your proud destinies:\r\nBorn were ye not like brutes for swinish ease,\r\nBut virtue and high knowledge to pursue.'\r\nMy comrades with such zeal did I imbue\r\nBy these brief words, that scarcely could I then\r\nHave turned them from their purpose; so again\r\nWe set out poop against the morning sky,\r\nAnd made our oars as wings wherewith to fly\r\nInto the Unknown. And ever from the right\r\nOur course deflecting, in the balmy night\r\nAll southern stars we saw, and ours so low,\r\nThat scarce above the sea-marge it might show.\r\nSo five revolving periods the soft,\r\nPale light had robbed of Cynthia, and as oft\r\nReplenished since our start, when far and dim\r\nOver the misty ocean's utmost rim,\r\nRose a great mountain, that for very height\r\nPassed any I had seen. Boundless delight\r\nFilled us - alas, and quickly turned to dole:\r\nFor, springing from our scarce-discovered goal,\r\nA whirlwind struck the ship; in circles three\r\nIt whirled us helpless in the eddying sea;\r\nHigh on the fourth the fragile stern uprose,\r\nThe bow drove down, and, as Another chose,\r\nOver our heads we heard the surging billows close.\"",
          "Love came to us in time gone by\r\nWhen one at twilight shyly played\r\nAnd one in fear was standing nigh,\r\nFor Love at first is all afraid.\n\r\nWe were grave lovers. Love is past\r\nThat had his sweet hours many a one;\r\nWelcome to us now at the last\r\nThe ways that we shall go upon.",

We turn our faces\r\nTo what the eternal evening brings.\n\r\nOur hands are hot and raw with the stones we have laid,\r\nWe have built a tower of stone high into the sky.\r\nWe have built a city of towers.\r\nOur hands are light, they are singing with emptiness.\r\nOur souls are light. They have shaken a burden of hours. . . .\r\nWhat did we build it for? Was it all a dream? . . .\r\nGhostly above us in lamplight the towers gleam . . .\r\nAnd after a while they will fall to dust and rain;\r\nOr else we will tear them down with impatient hands;\r\nAnd hew rock out of the earth, and build them again.",
